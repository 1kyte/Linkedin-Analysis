My particular interest is in getting to know the client's business and advising on the intellectual property strategy to best align with their commercial objectives. \n\nI draft and prosecute patent applications, advise on patent validity, infringement and freedom to operate and run patent oppositions. I specialise in the areas of molecular biology, biochemistry, genetics, microbiology, pharmaceuticals and research tools. I manage the life science group in the Sydney office of DCC and represent many local and international clients in the protection of inventions in all aspects of biotechnology including: medical therapeutics and diagnostics; biochemical, genetic and molecular biological markers; microbiology; immunology; transgenic organisms; nutraceuticals and food supplements; and medical and molecular biological research methods. I also have expertise in matters relating to devices for use in medical treatment, diagnostics and molecular biology research, for example including ocular devices, drug-eluting stents and laboratory research devices and equipment.\n\nHaving been awarded the University Medal I completed my PhD at the CSIRO Division of Biomolecular Engineering in Sydney before taking up an NHMRC CJ Martin Postdoctoral Fellowship in the UK at the University of Oxford, Department of Biochemistry. I am the author of numerous research papers in peer-reviewed international journals and have contributed to texts in the fields of antibiotic resistance and molecular microbiology. I continue to lecture widely on biotechnology patenting issues.\n\nI also take a very keen interest in translational research and the growth of the biotechnology industry. I am currently a mentor in the SPARK Sydney Program and a member of the NSW AusBiotech committee.",

The cadetship program involves rotations and I am currently completing my second rotation with the pro bono team.\n\nGilbert + Tobin's pro bono team work in a variety of areas. Majority of the work involves assisting refugees, working with the Homeless Persons' Legal Service, providing governance advice to Indigenous corporations and not-for-profits and residential tenancy law. \n\nAs a paralegal with pro bono I provide assistance to lawyers by reviewing and editing submissions, drafting letters to clients, drafting documents for tribunal and court, researching, attending meetings with clients and providing any additional support to lawyers and partners within G+T. All of the work completed with the pro bono team has been varied and has provided me with the exposure to areas of law I would not have had the opportunity to experience. \nI am currently working one day per week in this role while completing my studies.\n\nDuring my first rotation I was a research assistant at Gilbert + Tobin within the Knowledge Management team. This position primarily involved drafting and submitting internal updates to keep lawyers informed of any changes in the law or any relevant current affairs within the various practice groups. This work was then extended to include drafting correspondence to clients that aimed to update them on any changes in the law or current affairs relevant to their business. I also assisted lawyers by providing research to assist in understanding the current laws in various areas of commercial law and refugee law when a lawyer was undertaking pro bono work."
