		"description": "A career history in finding the right people for the right jobs, but a passion for developing people and their potential. I'm a true believer that foundations for success don't begin with a business, its services or its infrastructure, but with the community working within it and the support they're given to thrive. Plenty of buzzwords could describe for you how important that is to me, but instead, let me tell you a couple of things that really excite me about this people passion of mine. I come to work every day with the opportunity to work with and develop relationships at every level of the business, I'm exposed to the incredible diversity of thought and skill that a large company like Urban Utilities has to offer, and I get to embrace some seriously cool tech that makes my role less 'admin' and more 'people'. \n\nMy career means I get to spend every day influencing leaders, showing people how to best align their values and skills, and placing them in positions they enjoy getting up and coming to work for. \n\nI've got a not-so-hidden 'talent' for making people feel comfortable and welcomed, and I'm committed to carrying that with me where ever I go. I get so much fulfilment out of seeing people do their best. So here's to people power!",

		"description": "During my 8+ years providing ICT support within Queensland Government, I have gained extensive experience in providing client and technology management, including investigation of solutions for complex ICT issues and requirements.\nIn my current role as Support Analyst in the Brisbane South West region, I provide dedicated end user support and advice to clients both onsite and remotely. This involves support for various mobile, PC and network technologies, which include: Apple, Blackberry, Windows operating systems, and non-standards softwares approved through our Client Technology Reference Group (CTRG).\nTo ensure my clients gain the most from Information Service’s ICT services, I provide one-on-one training both in person and remotely for: use of mobile devices, use of applications and new operating systems. Not only do I manage client ICT requirements for the Brisbane South West region, I also work in the Brisbane CBD 2x days per week to assist with workload management and coordination.\nI have extensive operational support in both Microsoft applications and operating systems. This is evident through my ability to respond rapidly to service incidents and requests, whilst recognising gaps and opportunities for improvement in current procedures.\nWhilst improving procedures, I consult with stakeholders and address all issues using tact and diplomacy promoting the benefits and obtaining key stakeholder approval. Once I obtain appropriate approval for these changes, I implement them and report on the progress and benefits.\nIn my ICT career, I strive to regularly acquire and update new skills so I can provide the best possible solutions using up to date methods and practices. Recently I coordinated the development and implementation of a business solution in which our clients are able to utilise an offline laptop environment while complying with the department’s policies and procedures."

Go Insurance was developed on the premise of empowering travellers by allowing them to tailor their cover specific to their itinerary and budget. \n\nI am passionate about helping individuals, companies, groups and schools make informed, independent decisions about their specific needs.  \n\nI like to innovate and have created a range of specialist covers through Go Insurance, some of which are first in their field.  By constantly creating new ways of offering niche, group and corporate travel insurance, I will do what I can to find solutions for clients.  \n\nWith an ethos centred around flexibility, Go Insurance provides travel insurance direct to travellers or via distribution channels such as travel agents, tour operators and insurance brokers.\n\nI am always keen to chat about insurance and how I may be able to help, so please feel free to touch base.",

This means, developing a strong understanding not only of your business, but your culture, sub-cultures, Managers and their management style, growth plans and the things you have struggled with from a recruitment perspective, past and present. This approach allows us to be a true extension of your brand and a real advocate for your organisation and internal ethos in order to deliver a more tailored approach.\n\nIn addition, we see our Candidates as being equally as important as our Clients. Not only do we delve into our Candidate's technical capability, we like to know what motivates and demotivates them. We like to get a good understanding of not only their career plans, but what makes then tick as an individual and what makes them unique outside of their work life! By doing this, we can align their core values with not only their ideal role, but their ideal manager or mentor. By gathering this information, we're able to be proactive by taking our Candidate's details to market as opposed to a 'wait and see' approach - which is how we find most of our Candidate's their new and exciting opportunities! We're also here to give advice, coaching tips around CV's, interview techniques and market trends. \n\nHere at Humanised, we're not just about the transaction! Long term partnerships and a deeper understanding of our Clients and Candidates is paramount. \n\nAcross Data Analytics and Business Intelligence (B.I) we specialise in temporary and permanent staffing solutions across all verticals relative to the Data Analytics space.\n\nCollectively, we're meeting approximately 120 experienced Candidate's on a monthly basis and pride ourselves on having met and referenced these Candidate's before we represent them to our Clients."

Pete’s priority is working with customers to provide real safety solutions whilst reducing their total spend.

As the Lead Architect, I plan, design, deliver and verify the implementation of Intelligent Process Automation (IPA) tools to work within a given client’s infrastructure.\n\nDuring my time with Ascension I created the operations and support team structure and have created many of the policies, procedures and documentation that are still in use today.  From this experience, I created and deliver a training course to clients on how to establish and build a Robotic Process Automation (RPA) operations and support program.  This training covers, at a high level, the ACoE structure required to successfully operate an automation program. The training then goes into more detail on the roles and responsibilities of an automation team, reporting and analytics, documentation, and the development life cycle.\n\nAs a globally recognized BluePrism expert, I have used my skills for clients in a Design Authority (DA) position.  Helping clients establish standards and best practices, conducting peer reviews of processes, and auditing existing production processes evaluating design and efficiency.  I also perform audits of client’s automation infrastructure and made recommendations for improvement to increase the productivity and efficiency of their digital workforce. \n\nMy duties also include responsibilities within Agilify Collabratory®.  I regularly review new IPA related products and their claimed features , I help solve complex problems by combining technologies and providing new ways of delivering value through automation.  I participated in the development of IEEE 2755 to establish the taxonomy and nomenclature to be used within the IPA space."

My “Document Management Rejections” project automated the handling of 56 percent of all rejected documents and has created $446,206 in life to date ROI. I automated the Ascension’s job opening requisitions process simplifying the process for managers across the enterprise and has created $419,414 life to date ROI.  \n\nI created a full suite of Microsoft Exchange functions to integrate with Blue Prism and created architecture to run multiple bots, decreasing linear runtime and increasing bot productivity. I designed two automation dashboards critical to Blue Prism operations. The first monitors ROI, transactions, exceptions, and bot utilization and efficiency. The second provides real-time monitoring of bot process indicators."
