Over the course of my travel, I gained a new and more worldly perspective on so many aspects of life through visiting exciting places and meeting interesting people. I have also gained valuable skills of self-reliance, humility and assertiveness by being pushed outside of my comfort zone at many points in the trip. I studied history and classics in my undergraduate degree, and it has always been a passion for me, which made my highlights during my travel the many different historical locations and remnants that I was able to witness on my journey.\n\nSo far, studying at Melbourne Law School has been one the most empowering and rewarding period of my life. The calibre of my peers has challenged me to reach my highest potential and made me realise the breadth of opportunities that are open to me. The degree itself has not only given me an understanding of the law, but has improved my work ethic, critical thinking, logical reasoning, and public speaking skills. \n\nI consider myself to be a kind and thoughtful person, and enjoy being good company to those around me. I am often commended on my hard work ethic and professional manner, and pride myself on my social skills. I am an avid supporter of the Essendon Football Club and enjoy the opportunities when I get to watch them play in person. Some of my other hobbies and interests include strength training, reading, writing and history.\n\nI have worked for Camberwell Swim School between 2008 and 2017, where I taught squad and ‘learn to swim’ classes with kids between the ages of 3 and 16. Through teaching swimming I have gained invaluable communicative skills and learnt to handle responsibility.\n\nI have aspired to work as a lawyer for several years now, and I am excited by the skills of detail analysis and advocacy, intrinsic to law.","firstName":"Liam","lastName":"O&#39;Callaghan"},"jobs":[{"companyName":"Baker McKenzie","companyUrl":"https://www.linkedin.com/company/3957/","jobTitle":"Paralegal","dateRange":"Mar 2018 – Present","location":"Melbourne, Australia","description":null},{"companyName":"Baker McKenzie","companyUrl":"https://www.linkedin.com/company/3957/","jobTitle":"Summer Clerk","dateRange":"Jan 2018 – Feb 2018","location":null,"description":null},{"companyName":"Herbert Smith Freehills","companyUrl":"https://www.linkedin.com/company/7278/","jobTitle":"Vacation Clerk","dateRange":"Nov 2017 – Dec 2017","location":"Melbourne, Australia","description":"As a clerk at HSF, I worked in the Finance team and was exposed to matters in\n      Corporate and Project Finance.

The first  priorities were to create a senior executive, rebuild staff morale and build the confidence of clients.\n\nAll corporate functions were developed and implemented for Conneq to operate autonomously: a financial  system, policies, processes, procedures, a communications plan, a strategic HR program, and risk and  compliance.  The Executive Leadership Team was completely overhauled with Executive Directors for  operations and business development, a Finance Director, an HR Director, a General Counsel and a Strategy  Executive.\n\nFrom 2002 to 2010 the turnover increased 10 fold and employee numbers grew from 400 to circa 4000.\n\nA five year strategic plan was initiated in 2008 focussing Conneq on three priority industries: power, mining  & minerals, and oil & gas.  Selective opportunities in motorways and water network services were sought.\n\nA program of acquisitions diversified Conneq’s capabilities including EPC contracting (ex Simon Carves),  industrial and mining services, power services, and switchgear design and manufacture.  Integrations of  acquisitions were highly successful with some  more than doubling their turnover and all exceeding  their profit targets.
