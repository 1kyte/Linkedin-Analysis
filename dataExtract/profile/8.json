Some of Dr MacDonald’s specific clinical areas of interests include addiction psychiatry, adult ADHD, mood disorders and psychopharmacology.\n\nHe graduated with first class honours through Monash University and with the Geoff Conron Prize in Psychiatry, then trained at The Alfred, Melbourne and St Patrick’s Hospital, Dublin. Dr MacDonald’s curiosity about the interface between medicine and psychiatry led him to train in Consultation-Liaison psychiatry and complete research in the area of conversion disorder. He was an Adjunct Lecturer for Monash University, and has received prizes for writing online learning modules for medical students. He has been actively engaged in tertiary consultation for a number of health services in Melbourne before he moved to the Gold Coast in 2014 where he worked as the Northern Community Clinical Lead for Gold Coast HHS.\n\nAs a Consultation-Liaison Psychiatrist, he has become more accustomed to balancing competing interests, collaborating broadly with staff of varying disciplines, understanding how clinical and management staff interact within complex operational systems, and supervising staff of different professional backgrounds. He has an interest in teaching and research, which includes presenting educational topics to clinical and non-clinical staff in an effort to promote mental health literacy in our community. \n\nDr MacDonald was previously a state-level cricket player, runs marathons occasionally despite acquiring numerous injuries, and was a hopeless rugby player.","firstName":"Dr","lastName":"Tim MacDonald"},"jobs":[{"companyName":"Currumbin Clinic","companyUrl":"https://www.linkedin.com/company/7784540/","jobTitle":"Unit Director, Dual Diagnosis","dateRange":"Dec 2016 – Present","location":null,"description":null},{"companyName":"Currumbin Clinic","companyUrl":"https://www.linkedin.com/company/7784540/","jobTitle":"Consultant Psychiatrist","dateRange":"Jan 2014 – Present","location":"Currumbin Clinic","description":"Inpatient and outpatient treatment\n      \n\n    \n      Director, Mens Personal Development Program"},{"companyName":"John Flynn Private Hospital","companyUrl":"https://www.linkedin.com/company/7001554/","jobTitle":"Consultation-Liaison Psychiatrist","dateRange":"Mar 2014 – Present","location":"Tugun","description":"Offering primary, secondary and tertiary consultation the obstetric, medical and\n      \n      surgical teams at John Flynn Private Hospital"},{"companyName":"Gold Coast Hospital and Health Service","companyUrl":"https://www.linkedin.com/company/3287475/","jobTitle":"Northern Community Clinical Lead","dateRange":"Feb 2014 – Jun 2014","location":null,"description":"Clinical governance of the Continuing Care Team (CCT) and Mobile Intensive\n      Rehabilitation Team (MIRT) services, based at Ashmore Community Mental Health\n      \n      Service"},{"companyName":"Malvern Private Hospital","companyUrl":"https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/index/?keywords=Malvern%20Private%20Hospital","jobTitle":"Psychiatrist","dateRange":"Apr 2013 – Jan 2014","location":null,"description":"Addiction Psychiatry"},{"companyName":"Peninsula Health","companyUrl":"https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/index/?keywords=Peninsula%20Health","jobTitle":"Consultation-Liaison Psychiatrist","dateRange":"May 2012 – Jan 2014","location":null,"description":"Consultant Psychiatrist for the emergency department, psychiatric (phone) triage, and\n      \n      Consultation-Liaison services.

June – I bought another minivan and traveled across the US through several states, visiting relatives and exploring our lovely country.

The most satisfying part of my job is making a positive difference to my clients’ lives when I settle their claim.”\n\nLloyd is a keen on- and off-road motorcyclist and supporter of Maurice Blackburn’s Sorry Mate I Didn’t See You (SMIDSY) motorcycle safety campaign.\n\n“Having been exposed to the increased dangers as a motorcyclist and to the many hazards we face on the roads, I am able to empathise with the riders who are injured.\n\n“I have a strong interest in changing policies and laws so they better represent motorcyclists’ interests on the road. Being a road safety lawyer and a rider puts me in a better position to understand the impact of any proposals to design safer roads or legislative changes to enhance road safety.”\n\nIn addition to being an enthusiastic rider and MotoGP fanatic, Lloyd plays football for the Balwyn Tigers.","firstName":"Lloyd","lastName":"Toffolon"},"jobs":[{"companyName":"Maurice Blackburn Lawyers","companyUrl":"https://www.linkedin.com/company/363310/","jobTitle":"Lawyer","dateRange":"Apr 2016 – Present","location":"Melbourne, Australia","description":null},{"companyName":"Maurice Blackburn Lawyers","companyUrl":"https://www.linkedin.com/company/363310/","jobTitle":"Trainee Lawyer","dateRange":"Mar 2015 – Mar 2016","location":"Melbourne, Australia","description":null},{"companyName":"Maurice Blackburn Lawyers","companyUrl":"https://www.linkedin.com/company/363310/","jobTitle":"Library Assistant","dateRange":"Jul 2014 – Feb 2015","location":"Melbourne, Australia","description":null}],"schools":[{"schoolUrl":"https://www.linkedin.com/school/10224/?legacySchoolId=10224","schoolName":"Deakin University","degree":"Bachelor of Laws (LLB) and Bachelor of Arts","degreeSpec":"Law","dateRange":"2010 – 2015"}],"details":{"linkedinProfile":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/lloyd-toffolon-4a34a087"},"skills":[{"name":"Teamwork","endorsements":"11"},{"name":"Customer Service","endorsements":"11"},{"name":"Research","endorsements":"9"},{"name":"Legal Assistance","endorsements":"9"},{"name":"Legal Writing","endorsements":"2"},{"name":"Legal Research","endorsements":"1"},{"name":"Microsoft Office","endorsements":"5"},{"name":"Public Speaking","endorsements":"8"},{"name":"Dispute Resolution","endorsements":"7"},{"name":"Mediation","endorsements":"6"},{"name":"Management","endorsements":"4"}],"allSkills":"Teamwork, Customer Service, Research, Legal Assistance, Legal Writing, Legal Research, Microsoft Office, Public Speaking, Dispute Resolution, Mediation, Management"},{"general":{"imgUrl":"https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/C5603AQGEx7BQAU2J8w/profile-displayphoto-shrink_800_800/0?e=1545264000&v=beta&t=J20atVDlvPHDelSVqtSoEVuAwXs1NDtxiacAZMZSRA8","fullName":"Anthony Forsyth","headline":"Workplace Law Professor at RMIT University; Consultant at Corrs Chambers Westgarth","company":"RMIT University","school":"University of Melbourne","location":"Melbourne, Australia","connections":"500+","description":"Anthony is a Consultant with the Corrs Chambers Westgarth Workplace Relations Group.
