executive with a strong track record of delivering financial results and strong customer NPS across institutional banking, private wealth management and debt capital markets. Visionary, pragmatic, focused, commercial, respected, courageous and performance driven are words that describe my leadership style, my capability and my attitude. \n\nMy true strength is in how I knit strategy and the team’s belief together to bring people on the execution journey. This is where the real work starts. Activities are wasteful without the right focus and culture to deliver daily in pursuit of customer service. I am a very passionate people leader and believe that business is a team sport. This is why I am complimenting my extensive business and financial markets formal education with my Masters in HR Management. Mobilising large teams of people to execute strategy, while undergoing significant organisational change, is enormously challenging and my studies help me determine how to scale, what I do intuitively, around people leadership and management. \n\nI have an enormous curiosity about learning while doing that is evidenced by my re-designing businesses and shaping cultures to meet the rapidly changing customer value propositions that simply challenge the way things have been done for decades. Risk is central to my thinking and I balance business growth with de-risking when the right capabilities are not in place. I am very comfortable with ambiguity and I manage ambiguity for teams, consistently demonstrating a strong vision for the business I lead, letting teams know where we are going and how we are going to get there.  \n\nMy aspiration is to keep growing as a leader so I can bring out the best in people and in teams; all in pursuit of excellence in customer experience.","firstName":"Christine","lastName":"Yates"},"jobs":[{"companyName":"National Australia Bank","companyUrl":"https://www.linkedin.com/company/2357/","jobTitle":"General Manager Fixed Income Strategic Initiatives","dateRange":"Aug 2018 – Present","location":"Sydney, Australia","description":"For the past 4 years I have led Australia’s largest Private Bank and now I’ve been given\n      the opportunity to leverage my long career in Institutional Banking, particularly debt\n      markets, to create links between investors and investment opportunities.
