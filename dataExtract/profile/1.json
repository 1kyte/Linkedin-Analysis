She looks beyond the obvious, peeling apart the layers by asking the right questions at the right time. She makes the connections, builds the relationships, digging deeper and aiming higher.  As the founding Director of Who Am I Projects, Lisa successfully combines accreditations, skills and experience with an incredible sense of curiosity, intuition and compassion. She’s also a diehard 80’s fan (don’t judge), although she doesn’t mind the occasional 90’s rock (and, naturally, is totally obsessed with Adele). \nAfter starting her career with a Bachelor of Arts in Management Communication and a Certificate IV in Workplace Assessment & Training, Lisa graduated from the renowned Life Coaching Academy.

I am a HR professional with over 10 years experience and a proven track record in all areas of strategic and operational Human Resource Management.  Degree qualified (BComm) and a certified professional member of the Australian Human Resource Institute.  I started my career within the financial services sector in the UK, and I returned to this industry nearly 7 years later when I was appointed Executive Manager, Human Resources of award winning HOSTPLUS Superannuation Fund.  I have worked across many industries.  These comprise large international and Australian companies including The Royal Bank of Scotland, the iconic GM Holden and Australian giants Wesfarmers and Coles.\n\nThis wealth of experience means I am able to create compelling Employer Value Propositions for organisations, proof of which was illustrated when in 2008 I helped HOSTPLUS win a coveted spot in the top 50 BRW Best Places to work.  Ranked 35th HOSTPLUS was proud to stand along slide global giants such as Coca Cola and Google when they asked employees “Taking everything into account this is a great place to work!”\n\nMy no nonsense, straight talking approach enables me to connect more effectively with managers and business owners.  Seeking to understand your business and the outcomes you need, my talent is around developing solutions that fit and that deliver optimal results.","firstName":"Emily","lastName":"Jaksch"},"jobs":[{"companyName":"HR Gurus Pty
