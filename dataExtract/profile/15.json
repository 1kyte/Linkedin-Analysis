I post graduated in HR in 2015. As a person, I am energetic & fun loving, who sees life as a challenge and love challenges. I have a positive attitude in every task given to me, one who never thinks about results but work efficiently and dedicatedly towards the goal because according to me, thinking about results wastes your present and working smartly and efficiently results in better future.\n\nMy Objectives in life are to live a happy life positively and to create a better future. For me, no dream, no objective and no goal is too big to achieve, what matters is how you see it and work towards it.","firstName":"Priyal","lastName":"Chauhan"},"jobs":[{"companyName":"Infynno Solutions","companyUrl":"https://www.linkedin.com/company/13759544/","jobTitle":"Business Development Executive","dateRange":"Jun 2018 – Present","location":"Ahmedabad Area, India","description":null},{"companyName":"Ascendum Solutions","companyUrl":"https://www.linkedin.com/company/28417/","jobTitle":"HR","dateRange":"Mar 2017 – Present","location":null,"description":null},{"companyName":"Inexture Solutions LLP","companyUrl":"https://www.linkedin.com/company/9400239/","jobTitle":"HR Executive","dateRange":"Sep 2015 – Present","location":"Ahmedabad Area, India","description":"Handling the entire gamut of HR activities (Recruitment, Employee Engagement, PMS, Address Employees Grievances, Payroll, HRIS, HR Operation Transactions, General Affairs). \n•Successful Transition of employees from another company. \n•Statutory compliance. \n•Resource planning to achieve maximum utilization in the organization. \n•Concentrated efforts on effective networking methods to reach the greatest number of potential candidates through industry leads & sources, employee referral program, head hunting, client/colleague, through a number of proven techniques like direct, job sites, career fairs, direct mailing, user groups. \n•Planning and strategizing for all the recruitment within defined time frames. \n•Development and implementation of interview process assuring quality interviews and focusing on right skills for respective positions. \n•Development and implementation of recruitment strategies. \nMeeting the recruitment deadline by short listing the candidates and negotiating on salary part with complete reference check tool. \n•Taking care of Employee Relations. \n•Planning Yearly calendar related to various Training,Social get together, \nSettlement. \n•Handling Exit Interview, joining formalities, Induction of new joinees, In-house activities related to New Year, Festival Celebrations etc \n•Designing various forms like Interview assessment form, full and final form, Job description, Feedback and Training Calendar for the year."},{"companyName":"Virgo UAP Pharma","companyUrl":"https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/index/?keywords=Virgo%20UAP%20Pharma","jobTitle":"HR Intern","dateRange":"Jun 2014 – Aug 2014","location":"Ahmedabad Area, India","description":"“To identify the Labour Productivity issues and measures to improve it”\n\n • Acquired details about Labour Productivity \n • Surveyed labours through close ended questions and suggestions \n   given to improve labour productivity."}],"schools":[{"schoolUrl":"https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/index/?keywords=KIRC","schoolName":"KIRC","degree":"Master of Business Administration (M.B.A.)","degreeSpec":"Human Resources Management/Personnel Administration","dateRange":"2013 – 2015"},{"schoolUrl":"https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/index/?keywords=BWTIBA","schoolName":"BWTIBA","degree":"Bachelor of Business Administration (BBA)","degreeSpec":"Human Resources Management/Personnel Administration","dateRange":"2010 – 2013"}],"details":{"linkedinProfile":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/priyalchauhan","websites":"inexture.com"},"skills":[{"name":"Human Resources","endorsements":"99+"},{"name":"Communication Skills","endorsements":"92"},{"name":"Personnel Management","endorsements":"99+"},{"name":"Human Resource Development","endorsements":"44"},{"name":"Recruiting","endorsements":"99+"},{"name":"Screening","endorsements":"99+"},{"name":"Performance Management","endorsements":"99+"},{"name":"Project Management","endorsements":"74"},{"name":"HR Policies","endorsements":"80"},{"name":"HR Consulting","endorsements":"61"},{"name":"Data Entry","endorsements":"43"},{"name":"Microsoft Office","endorsements":"99+"},{"name":"Human Resources Information Systems (HRIS)","endorsements":"40"},{"name":"Performance Appraisal","endorsements":"99+"},{"name":"Team Management","endorsements":"99+"},{"name":"Employee Engagement","endorsements":"98"},{"name":"Employee Relations","endorsements":"99+"},{"name":"Talent Management","endorsements":"69"},{"name":"Training","endorsements":"99+"},{"name":"Interviewing","endorsements":"50"},{"name":"Waterfall -
