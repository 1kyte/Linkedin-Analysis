What I do have is an unparalleled experience and knowledge of helping Accounting firms achieve peak performance and how they can change their lives and the lives of their clients for the better.\n\n► I believe Accountants are the number one in numbers - not a piece of software.\n► I believe Accountants can be (actually need to be) the trusted advisor.\n► I believe Accountants do not earn enough for how smart they are and the value that they add.\n► I believe Accountants should be making >$1M profit per partner whilst working less than 500 client hours.\n► I believe Accountants can help their clients build amazing businesses.\n► I believe Accountants should help their clients make history instead of writing it up.\n► I believe Accountants can change lives!\n\nMy speaking work has taken me around the world where I have spoken to more than 175,000 accountants. Currently my landmark strategies and products are used by accountants in over 35 countries. \n\nIn 2005 I created the revolutionary coaching model called coachingclub. The coachingclub model enabled firms to be accountable, to consistently learn and to share ideas amongst their peers. I have personally coached 434 firms under this coaching model and helped add more than $850M of new profit to them. \n\nOver the past few years I have authored 3 books “Accounting Practices Don’t Add Up – why they don’t and what to do about it” AND “Remaining Relevant – the future of the Accounting profession” AND “The Perfect Firm”. All have been best sellers. \n\nIn 2014 I released a software solution called PANALITIX. Accountancy firms around the world use PANALITIX to get better numbers and delight their clients. \n\nI now mentor Accountants from all over the world. \n\nOn a personal note. I am keen golfer and adventurer (I am ticket holder 293 on Virgin Galactic to go into space). I live in sunny Brisbane, Australia.",

I have trained them, coached them, mentored them, and created products for them and built companies that serve them.  \n\nWith my mentoring and coaching of Partners in Accounting firms I help them do 3 things:\n\n1.\tMake over $1M profit per partner whilst working less than 500 client hours.\n2.\tBuild amazing Accounting businesses.\n3.\tChange the lives of themselves and their clients.\n\nSo far I have directly coached 434 firms and have helped to add more than $850M of additional profit to them. Due to time constraints I cannot take on every coaching / mentoring request. \n\nEach year I work with a small group of qualified firms who want to achieve the 3 objectives above. My coaching methods produce unprecedented results for Accountants however it's not for everyone. \n \nMy coaching is NOT for:\n\n► Accounting firms that have a track record of FTI - Failure To Implement.\n► Beginner Accounting firms - you need to have already implemented the basics.\n► Small Accounting firms - you need to be established and have at least US$500K in annual revenue.\n► Large Accounting firms - if you’re over $10M then we can look at something different.\n\nMy coaching IS for:\n\n► Ambitious firms who want to dominate and double or triple profit in the near future.\n► Good firms now - measured by awards, good KPI's or what you have already implemented.\n► Firms that implement - must have track record of implementation.\n► Good people who are fun to work with!\n\nIf you'd like to explore a coaching relationship then send me an email with a bit of background on your firm and what you'd like to achieve - rob@robnixon.com\n\nSome examples of firms I have helped over the years are below:"

Gary Johnstone \n\n\"I had to pay my ATO debt urgently and my bank said no. A friend told me to talk to Paul from Auswise Finance. Best phone call I ever made. Paul immediately offered me a solution via a short term 2nd mortgage that was set up and approved in a very short time. My ATO debt was sorted, and then he financed me back into a better mainstream structure when the loan term had ended. I would recommend Paul to anyone\".

My work at Sanity continued on my return to Melbourne and I was promoted to the position of Store Manager and moved through a variety of Victorian locations.  My passion and results were recognised and I was subsequently promoted to be an Area Manager responsible for a number of Victorian stores.  Wanting to develop my retail management skills within a different category, I accepted the challenging role of Store Manager- Chadstone for Sportsgirl.\n\nWhilst on the job hunt for my next retail management challenge, I was interviewed as a candidate at Retailworld Resourcing and was offered and accepted the opportunity to be an Account Manager.  In this role, my work focused on recruiting for junior retail management positions within the hardware, technology and sports categories.  I was recognised for achieving some fantastic results for my clients and candidates and I was promoted to being an Executive Account Manager where I focused on Senior Operations and Visual Merchandising roles across all retail disciplines.\n\nBeing very focused on quality, and wanting to work within a flexible and professional culture, in August 2009, Stephen Moir and I launched RECRUIT2retail AUSTRALIA.\n\nSpecialties: RECRUIT2retail AUSTRALIA partner with some of Australia’s best known national retailers as well as a number of amazing independent and boutique businesses.\n\nWe have sourced talented candidates in all states and territories, for both metro and regional locations, in retail store operations, head office and executive positions.\n\nCategories have included: large format; department store; furniture and homewares; fashion and footwear; jewellery and accessories; sports and leisure; health and beauty.",
