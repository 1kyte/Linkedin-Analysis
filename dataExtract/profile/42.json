		"description": "A highly credible General/Commercial Manager with a talent for organisational review and design, I’m a transformative leader who consistently delivers exceptional business results. Throughout my career in professional services, I have worked with numerous high profile organisations to lead the delivery of transformative change programs, identify significant risks and opportunities for improvement and drive human capital performance.\n\nI care deeply about driving positive change, and believe that investing in creating authentic relationships at all levels is essential to gaining support and buy-in. To date, I’ve delivered a number of HR-led change programs spanning L&D, performance management, recruitment and resource realignment, and am confident in creating comprehensive strategic frameworks that embrace industry best practices. Comfortable interacting with partners, top management, boards, and large workforces, my communication style is effective and persuasive, reaching diverse audiences across all functions and levels. \n\nIntuitively creative, able to think laterally around operational issues, I synthesise solutions into deliverables and metrics that I can track, monitor and continue to improve. Keen to build networks of like-minded professionals, I seek to create connections in the business community.

We are difference because of the value we put on the development of a team approach with our clients, no judgement, no rushing and certainly half way measures. The client provides the instructions and we provide the guidance. As managing partner, client satisfaction is incredibly important to me. I strive to ensure my team provides the best service possible all the time. As a result, we enjoy an exceedingly high level of highly satisfied clients.\n\nImportantly, we are unlike other law firms in our areas of practice because we monitor our matters through ISO Standard Law 9000 and every client is asked to grade the service we provide. \n\nShould you require our services, the criminal law team, in Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane or Canberra, stand ready to assist you.

My speciality is in designing, delivering and managing innovative and practical workplace strategies to drive business objectives, deepen workplace engagement and foster effective connections between key stakeholders.\n\nFrom 2013 - 2017 I was the National Corporate Real Estate Services and Projects lead at KPMG. As Head of Workplace Services I was responsible for lease portfolio management, project management, acquisitions, property and change management nationally.\n\nAmong my key accomplishments I successfully managed KPMG’s largest, most expensive and most culturally influential property program in 25 years. I managed the national team (30 staff and numerous contractors) that implemented the firm’s ambitious Workplace of the Future project for 5000 staff, creating industry-leading agile workplaces at the iconic Lendlease development at Barangaroo in Sydney, the Walker Towers at Docklands in Melbourne, and also in Parramatta, Wollongong, Perth, Adelaide and Brisbane. The new offices totalled around 65,000 square-metres, generated overwhelmingly positive responses from partners, managers, staff and clients alike, received widespread attention from design media, and opened up new ways for KPMG to work, entertain and interact with clients.",

CSIRO solves Australia’s greatest challenges, turning excellent science into profound impact in partnership with industry, government, universities and the community.\n\nI'm a scientist, technology innovator and business leader with a wealth of experience in creating new value and impact with science. I have a PhD in Physics and became a global leader in laser research, for which I was honoured as a Federation Fellow and later as an ATSE (Australian Academy of Technology and Engineering) Fellow. \n\nI invented the “eye-safe” laser which enabled lasers to be used safely in public. I was inspired at Stanford to found my first company, Light Solutions, which invented the world’s first solid-state green laser for the treatment of blindness in diabetics. Light Solutions merged with infra-red laser company Iris Medical in 1995, and the green-laser sales propelled the new company Iridex to IPO (initial public offering) on Nasdaq. \n\nI was CEO/MD and founder of another five companies, frequently based on Stanford’s science, in biotechnology, telecommunications, semiconductors, and venture capital, including Arasor which I took public in 2006. In 2007, I became MD of Southern Cross Ventures, specialising in Australian innovation, where I delivered the first Nasdaq IPO of an Australian-venture backed startup commercialising science. \n\nI have over 100 publications and conference papers, hold 20 patents, and have served on 20 boards of high tech companies operating in the US, Australia and China. I am a Male Champion of Change committed to tackling gender equality. I am a passionate supporter of Australian innovation, returning to Australia to lead CSIRO, which I believe is the essential catalyst to improve Australia’s innovation performance.",

This proposal secured bipartisan support for a Decade of Landcare built on assistance for group approaches and integrated planning at property and catchment scales.  The NLF role involved meeting landcare groups and the people working with them throughout Australia, analysing their effectiveness, facilitating communication across state, disciplinary and institutional boundaries, and providing strategic advice to policy makers at State and national levels.  It provided a unique opportunity to explore the full range of land management issues and participatory approaches to research and extension, and to develop a contact network of outstanding farmers, scientists and extension agents throughout Australia.

Because today 91% of consumers would switch brands to one that supports a good cause. \n\nStanding for something is vital in today’s purpose revolution, as staff and customers want to know how companies are making the world a better place. If they stand for something they are rewarded with trust and loyalty and if they’re not they are boycotted.\n\nI have developed the Stand For Something Program, that takes a company through four steps to uncover what one key issue they should support and own, these are:\n\nASSESS: first we assess to see if you support the right cause in the right way. We look at your values to see if you are bringing them to life and see what key issues your staff and customers care about and what the gaps are.  \n\nALIGN: after careful assessment and input from your staff, customers and management we align you with the ideal cause that supports your values and business goals. \n\nAMPLIFY: we then infuse your social purpose into the DNA of your company. We ensure internal staff are engaged with your cause so support isn’t just an add-on PR exercise. Then create meaningful storytelling & values-driven PR. \n\nANALYSE: we then measure the impact of your social purpose (the measurable good you have done to your chosen cause), we also measure your social media engagement and PR exposure based on your values. \n\nTo kick start all this we run workshops that help companies find, support and promote their one key cause in a meaningful and long-term way so any charity support is never just a PR exercise but done authentically. \n\nPlease get in touch for a free assessment of your company’s current social purpose and ideas to help you get on the path to purpose.",

Always having an interest in the law, she later attended Law School where she earned herself a Juris Doctorate and developed a keen interest in commercial litigation. \n \nMelissa utilises her legal skills, passion, and knowledge to specialise on legal roles from junior lawyers to equity partners and firm mergers. Her interpersonal skills combined with her professional execution and commitment to her clients allows her to be successful in placing lawyers in the right role. She has an internal belief that her placement can make a huge different in that individual’s career path.  Melissa does not believe in shortcuts, as there are none in the longevity of her career or the career of her placements. Building lasting relationships is the key to her success.",

Systems: The backbone of your HR strategy, such as performance management & recruitment.\n2. Symbols: The non-verbal cues that embed or erode your culture. Think corner offices & carparks.\n3. Behaviours: Having clear expectations, a common language, and motivating leaders to walk the talk and articulate what’s being done right and wrong.\n\nHOW I WORK\nI work hard to understand your business inside and out. Then I design a best-fit HR solution to suit your business, your people and your maturity level. And I help you deliver, with processes, documentation, a rollout plan, leadership education and on-call support. \n\nWHO I WORK WITH\nI can help you with a single project, or become your go-to HR advisor. If you don’t have an HR manager, it can make sense to retain senior advice from an HR superstar who can make transformative change, vs hiring a full-time employee who is more likely to focus on incremental change.\n\nMy specialty is HR’s impact on customer service, with industry experience encompassing Professional Services, Banking, Technology, Government, Travel & Aviation."

However, I do like variety and have a curiosity about different people, roles and industries which has seen me recruit a broad range of corporate and operational roles in a range of industries without any prior experience in that space.  I also have an innate passion for continuous improvement and have developed and delivered a number of initiatives in the past which have improved the attraction, engagement and retention rates of quality candidates for my employers and clients.  \n\nI'm lucky after working in this area for some time I still love being an in-house talent specialist/recruitment specialist and ensuring I find people who not only have the right skills and experience but also the right cultural fit which makes them and the company a success match.  \n\nI truly enjoy working with both clients and candidates.  I partner with my hiring managers/clients so I can advise them on the best recruitment strategy and range of on-line and people search sources to find THE right person they are searching for.  With candidates, they know I am genuine about their interests and career goals and I have successfully built strong and ongoing relationships even with those who were ultimately unsuccessful. \n\nTo me, my focus is to create a WIN/WIN situation for all stakeholders.\n\nSPECIALITIES:\nDefence; ICT professionals - including project managers, business analysts, help desk engineers, systems analysts, enterprise architects, Agile consultants; Accountants, Aviation specialists and Managers and operational staff, learning and development and change management professionals as well as  fraud investigators, motor assessors and General Managers; cooks, chefs; and facility managers.",

This resulted in strong positive feedback from consultants and candidates.\n\n* Introduced best practice professional branding exercise on how to write effective LinkedIn profiles and to share posts and jobs on LinkedIn with their networks. This lead to more quality applications and direct approaches.\n\n* Promoted Elabor8's diversity policy through sponsorship and participation in a leading Professional Women’s Group in Brisbane.\n\n* Set up a new Women in Agile group in 2018 to encourage women who work in the Agile/Lean/Kanban space (or who want to) to attend, contribute as speakers and to inspire other women to get involved in the profession."
