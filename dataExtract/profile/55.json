Implementing a globally focused model of teaching and learning is imperative if schools are to adequately prepare students to be active citizens in a shrinking global world. \n\n I have a proven track record of successful inspired leadership and collaboration, which has been underpinned by a genuine interest in the development of the skills of colleagues. My role requires me to motivate and inspire my team towards the successful completion of our goal. \n\nI am a Nationally Certified Highly Accomplished Teacher and an accredited Coach.\n\nAs an educational leader, I have demonstrated that I value professional development, learning and the role of the teacher in assisting students to meet their goals. I have been a mentor to new staff as well as a supervisor of interns which demonstrates my commitment to teacher training and learning.",

The P&ID's included control philosophy and on-site orientation, designed to provide the basics of operation for each location. The team I was assigned to was a small, well oiled crew which allowed for great relationships and one on one lessons with the mentoring engineers.

Delivering at scale is complex, yet I have proven that by building focused teams and equipping them with tenacity, capacity and trust, transformation can not only deliver efficiencies, it can revolutionise company value propositions. For me, it’s about driving the buzz of benefits realisation. \nThe experience I bring to CLX Professionals spans the UK and Australia, where I have worked with retail giants such as Sainsbury’s, Coles and Travelex to transform front-end business operations into customer focused and highly optimised environments. I’ve led multimillion-dollar transformation projects encompassing checkouts, software deployments and cultural transformation, all of which have placed customer experience at the core of the solution. I have enabled and realised measurable commercial returns, including YOY growth, improved customer satisfaction and multimillion-dollar cost savings – all with the goal of driving reinvestment back into the business, its team members and of course, its customers. \nIn 2017, I founded specialist consultancy CLX Professionals to empower more retailers to embrace the pace of change in the industry, maximising shareholder return by creating unique customer experiences. Aligning emerging technology and best practice with unique retail environments, we build competitive differentiation, assessing and prioritising solutions based on ROI, and enabling organisations and their C-suite/executive teams to deliver sustainable results quickly via accelerated roll out and tight benefits tracking. \n\nIf you would like to find out more about CLX and how it can support your retail business, please free free to get in touch via LinkedIn.",
