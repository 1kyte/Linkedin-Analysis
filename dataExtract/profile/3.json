and\n• standstill/forbearance arrangements and strategic turnaround activities.\n\nA few examples of recent transactions I have acted on include advising:\n\n• an Australian bank on a secured loan to a borrower for the acquisition and refinance of over 100 social and affordable housing units;\n\n• a syndicate of banks on a secured loan facility to a borrowing group for corporate and working cap purposes in connection with its agri business;
