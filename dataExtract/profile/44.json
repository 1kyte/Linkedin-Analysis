Wear it Purple was established to show young people across the globe that there was hope, that there were people who did support and accept them, and that they have the right to be proud of who they are.\n\nSince 2010, when Wear it Purple was co-founded by Katherine Hudson and Scott Williams, Wear it Purple has developed into an international movement. New generations of rainbow young people continue to be dedicated to promoting the annual expression of support and acceptance to rainbow young people.\n\nWhat started out small has now grown; however the message remains the same. Everybody has the right to be proud of who they are.\n\nSo join us each year, on August 31 to celebrate Wear it Purple Day. Be part of a movement that has the potential to save thousands of lives. Be part of this change."},{"companyName":"ACON","companyUrl":"https://www.linkedin.com/company/38412/","jobTitle":"Senior Program Manager, Pride in Diversity & Pride in Sport","dateRange":"Dec 2015 – Jun 2017","location":null,"description":"Promoted to head two key programs - Pride in Diversity & Pride in Sport. 2IC to the Director, Pride Inclusion Programs. \n\nPeople Leadership of a team of five D&I Consultants and Team Assistant, working across 200+ client organisations in all industries and sectors. \n\nProgram Design & Management of two major LGBTI inclusion programs (Pride in Diversity and Pride in Sport), including membership, benefits realisation, training, consulting, executive engagement and coaching. \n\nExpert international consultant on all aspects of LGBTI inclusion."},{"companyName":"ACON","companyUrl":"https://www.linkedin.com/company/38412/","jobTitle":"Workplace Education & Relationship Manager, Pride in Diversity","dateRange":"Jun 2014 – Dec 2015","location":"Sydney Area, Australia","description":"LGBTI Diversity & Inclusion\n      \n\n    Client Relationship Management\n      \n\n    Diversity & Inclusion Strategy\n      \n\n    \n      Facilitation\n\n...

I am also passionate about transformation at an organisational level and believe that if leaders are able to openly discuss the dilemmas they find in overcoming resentment (the opposite of gratitude) and are supported in taking up gratitude practices, they can truly shine and lead from deep within.

Over the past two decades Kerry has been researching the role of gratitude in enhancing teaching and learning processes at all levels of education. She has published several academic papers that report on the findings of her research on the role of gratitude in the areas of school leadership, pre-service teacher education, and school education. Her book, Howells, K. (2012) Gratitude in Education: A Radical View is the first full text to be written on this topic, and has been hailed by reviewers around the world as “ground-breaking”. Kerry draws on a range of case studies in different levels of education – from primary to university - to outline a phenomenology of gratitude when it is placed in different contexts, and furthers our understanding of both the complexities and possibilities of gratitude for both education and other fields. Many in the field of Positive Psychology have been using this text in their practice and teaching courses. In her most recent work, Kerry has been exploring the implications for education of cultural differences in expressions of gratitude. She has conducted her investigation in the areas of Australian Aboriginal and Maori cultures, and following on from her time as a visiting scholar at the University of South Africa in 2014, in indigenous African culture. In June 2015 Kerry was invited by an NGO to speak at the United Nations on the relationship between gratitude and human dignity.\n\nKerry is also a public speaker and welcomes invitations to share her research. Her most recent invited speaker presentations on gratitude can be viewed at: \nTEDx talk : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gzfhPB_NtVc\nMind and its Potential, Sydney: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47hd5HTQV1E\nPositive Schools Conferences: http://www.positiveschools.com.au"},{"companyName":"University of Tasmania, Faculty of Education","companyUrl":"https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/index/?keywords=University%20of%20Tasmania%2C%20Faculty%20of%20Education","jobTitle":"Senior Lecturer, Curriculum and Pedagogy","dateRange":"Feb 2006 – Present","location":"Hobart, Tasmania","description":null}],"schools":[{"schoolUrl":"https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/index/?keywords=Faculty%20of%20Education","schoolName":"Faculty of Education","degree":"Doctor of Philosophy (PhD)","degreeSpec":"Philosophy of Education","dateRange":"1995 – 2001"}],"details":{"linkedinProfile":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/kerryhowells","websites":"utas.edu.au/profiles/staff/education/kerry-howells?referrer=Faculty%20of%20Education"},"skills":[{"name":"University Teaching","endorsements":"30"},{"name":"Lecturing","endorsements":"30"},{"name":"Curriculum Development","endorsements":"25"},{"name":"Academic Writing","endorsements":"17"},{"name":"Research","endorsements":"15"},{"name":"Higher Education","endorsements":"14"},{"name":"Curriculum Design","endorsements":"11"},{"name":"Pedagogy","endorsements":"9"},{"name":"Adult Education","endorsements":"6"},{"name":"Teaching","endorsements":"18"},{"name":"Public Speaking","endorsements":"14"},{"name":"Educational Leadership","endorsements":"10"},{"name":"Staff Development","endorsements":"9"},{"name":"Leadership Development","endorsements":"8"},{"name":"Organizational Development","endorsements":"8"},{"name":"Coaching","endorsements":"7"},{"name":"Qualitative Research","endorsements":"4"},{"name":"Teacher Training","endorsements":"2"},{"name":"Educational Research","endorsements":"12"},{"name":"Theory","endorsements":"19"},{"name":"Courses","endorsements":"7"},{"name":"Workshop Facilitation","endorsements":"6"}],"allSkills":"University Teaching, Lecturing, Curriculum Development, Academic Writing, Research, Higher Education, Curriculum Design, Pedagogy, Adult Education, Teaching, Public Speaking, Educational Leadership, Staff Development, Leadership Development, Organizational Development, Coaching, Qualitative Research, Teacher Training, Educational Research, Theory, Courses, Workshop Facilitation"},{"general":{"imgUrl":"https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/C5603AQHcV6zbpBVRLw/profile-displayphoto-shrink_800_800/0?e=1545264000&v=beta&t=bjR2yVCl90Ujyv8ClZErw-PNn4eIxyqyDGLcr7Sqz6o","fullName":"Dianne Vella-Brodrick","headline":"Professor of Positive Psychology at University of Melbourne","company":"University of Melbourne","school":"Monash University","location":"University Of Melbourne, Victoria, Australia","connections":"500+","description":"Professor Dianne Vella-Brodrick (PhD) is Deputy Director and Head of Research at the Centre for Positive Psychology at the Melbourne Graduate School of Education, University of Melbourne.

She says we can short-circuit our negative defaults by making a mental switch that flicks to shift our attention from weaknesses to strengths, and from the negative to positive news around us.\n\nIn her TEDx talk “Warning: Being Positive Is Not For The Faint Hearted”, Lea explores how we can spread positive messages in an effort to override the dominant message of fear and scarcity and make a collective difference in the world by spreading hope and happiness.\n\nAnd in her book “The Strength Switch” Lea says that the strength-based approach gives us the power to live the good life by drawing on our most abundant inner resources (our strengths!). \n\nLea is passionate about helping people all over the world make the Strength Switch. Her ‘Positive Detective’ and ‘Visible Wellbeing” programs are being used by schools worldwide. \n\nLea has been featured in The Atlantic, The Wall Street Journal, The Guardian, and more.

As my first rotation it was the perfect introduction to Retail Leasing, as I learnt how to calculate percentage rent, outgoings and how to read/interpret a lease. I also got experience in handling property disputes, market reviews of rents, exercise of options, calculating occupancy costs and reviewing lease terms. \n\nIn August 2011 I commenced my second rotation in Capital Transactions and was exposed to negotiation, property strategy and analysis work. In particular, I was involved with feasibility analysis, strategic review of locations within NSW for potential sites, understanding town planning regulation, sourcing property ownership information and analysis of recent sales to determine a market value.\n\nI commenced my third rotation in Property Development in February 2012 and currently, I am continuing my learning and development within the program and the company."},{"companyName":"JDMA Property Consulting and Valuations","companyUrl":"https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/index/?keywords=JDMA%20Property%20Consulting%20and%20Valuations","jobTitle":"Valuer Assistant","dateRange":"Jan 2009 – Dec 2010","location":"Brisbane, Australia","description":null}],"schools":[{"schoolUrl":"https://www.linkedin.com/school/10233/?legacySchoolId=10233","schoolName":"Queensland University of Technology","degree":"Bachelor of Urban Development","degreeSpec":"Property Economics, Accounting","dateRange":"2007 – 2010"}],"details":{"linkedinProfile":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/ashleaborean"},"skills":[{"name":"Real Estate Development","endorsements":"14"},{"name":"Lease Administration","endorsements":"12"},{"name":"Retail","endorsements":"10"},{"name":"Feasibility Studies","endorsements":"8"},{"name":"Property Management","endorsements":"7"},{"name":"Analysis","endorsements":"5"},{"name":"Change Management","endorsements":"1"},{"name":"Negotiation","endorsements":"10"},{"name":"Property","endorsements":"7"}],"allSkills":"Real Estate Development, Lease Administration, Retail, Feasibility Studies, Property Management, Analysis, Change Management, Negotiation, Property"},{"general":{"fullName":"Darren Steinberg","headline":"CEO and Executive Director at Dexus","company":"Dexus","school":"The University of Western Australia","location":"Sydney, Australia","connections":"500+","description":"","firstName":"Darren","lastName":"Steinberg"},"jobs":[{"companyName":"Dexus","companyUrl":"https://www.linkedin.com/company/277249/","jobTitle":"CEO and Executive Director","dateRange":"Mar 2012 – Present","location":null,"description":null},{"companyName":"Colonial First State","companyUrl":"https://www.linkedin.com/company/2847/","jobTitle":"Managing Director Property","dateRange":"May 2009 – Mar 2012","location":null,"description":null},{"companyName":"Colonial First State","companyUrl":"https://www.linkedin.com/company/2847/","jobTitle":"Head of Listed Property Funds and Colonial First State Property Management","dateRange":"Nov 2006 – May 2009","location":null,"description":null},{"companyName":"Stockland","companyUrl":"https://www.linkedin.com/company/15429/","jobTitle":"Chief Executive Officer -
