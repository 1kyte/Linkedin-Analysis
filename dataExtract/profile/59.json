environments.\n\nTertiary qualified and with 9+ years of HR generalist experience, I started my career in 2008 working as the Organisational Development Coordinator for Kmart during the Wesfarmers acquisition of Coles Group.  At that early stage Kmart was regarded as the 'ugly duckling' of the Group and it was so rewarding contributing to the brand's transformation into one of Australia's most successful retailers. From Kmart I moved to Country Road in 2012, another household name in Australian retail, where my focus was on providing HR support for retail stores. During my tenure I was fortunate to be a part of Country Road's acquisition and integration of the Witchery & Mimco brands. \n\nExcited to experience a new and challenging industry I joined Aspen Pharma in 2013 as their HR Advisor. Aspen had acquired Sigma in 2011 resulting in the organisation expanding from a team of 60 to 950 staff. I was charged with establishing a variety of HR processes and policies to support the rapidly growing business.

There are five \"Blue Zones\" in the world where people live longer than anywhere else and the primary factor they share in common is a majority plant-based diet - not because of any moral/ethical/political concerns but simply due to what is sustainable. Okinawa, Japan is one of the five zones and has the highest number of centenarians in the world, largely due to a plant-based diet and high levels of matcha consumption. Matcha Mylkbar's menu is built around this research and a philosophy of putting the sustainability and longevity benefits of plant based eating at the Melbourne cafe culture's disposal in a way that takes the moral/political/ethical elements and stigma away from vegan dining. \n\nEach dish is designed to please all palates, preferences and dietary requirements. We have even developed a \"vegan egg\" made wholly of plant based materials but with the same consistency and texture of a regular egg. This is culinary innovation as you've never seen it before!

Our aim was to launch a bottled water product that would exist for the sole purpose of funding water projects in developing nations.\n\nIt was a tough startup journey and we encountered a lot of setbacks along the way. We were a group of young people with limited business experience but we had loads of determination and that was what drove us to continue building the business, even through the tough times. \n\nIn July 2013, after already having secured major deals with 7-Eleven Australia and Australia Post for our bottled water, we rebranded to Thankyou and launched two new ranges - Thankyou food and Thankyou body care. The reason behind this was to enable us to fund food and health and hygiene projects in developing nations as well as water projects. We also launched a bold campaign that resulted in Coles and Woolworths agreeing to stock our entire range of products, which catapulted our business into a season of strong growth, which meant our impact through our projects grew exponentially. \n\nIn February 2016, we launched our boldest move yet - Chapter One. A pay-what-you-want book of which 100% of the profits would fund the future of Thankyou. To date, thanks to the incredible support of the Australian public, we've raised over $1.4 million from sales of Chapter One. These funds will allow us to launch our baby range in late 2016 which will fund child and maternal health programs around the globe and our first international market in 2017, New Zealand. \n\nWe're excited that we've been able to help thousands of people gain access to water, food, hygiene and sanitation training and maternal and child health programs. Our aim is to keep growing so we can continue to impact many more lives in need, because we believe that together we can help end global poverty.","firstName":"Daniel","lastName":"Flynn"},"jobs":[{"companyName":"Thankyou","companyUrl":"https://www.linkedin.com/company/1341803/","jobTitle":"Managing Director and Co-founder","dateRange":"Aug 2008 – Present","location":"Melbourne, Australia","description":"My role as Managing Director involves driving the growth of Thankyou and overseeing\n      all high-level aspects of the business.\n      \n\n    \n      \n\n    My ultimate goal is to see Thankyou become a household name in Australia so we can\n      go from helping thousands of people with water, food and health and hygiene training,\n      \n      to one day helping millions of people in need."}],"schools":[{"schoolUrl":"https://www.linkedin.com/school/10234/?legacySchoolId=10234","schoolName":"RMIT University"}],"details":{"linkedinProfile":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/daniel-flynn-b0b5613b"},"skills":[{"name":"Marketing Strategy","endorsements":"99+"},{"name":"Management","endorsements":"99+"},{"name":"Start-ups","endorsements":"99+"},{"name":"Business Strategy","endorsements":"99+"},{"name":"Social Media Marketing","endorsements":"99+"},{"name":"Strategy","endorsements":"91"},{"name":"Marketing Communications","endorsements":"79"},{"name":"Social Media","endorsements":"61"},{"name":"Entrepreneurship","endorsements":"59"},{"name":"Event Management","endorsements":"34"},{"name":"Business Development","endorsements":"34"},{"name":"Business Planning","endorsements":"24"},{"name":"Sales","endorsements":"24"},{"name":"Online Advertising","endorsements":"17"},{"name":"SEM","endorsements":"10"},{"name":"Social Entrepreneurship","endorsements":"10"},{"name":"FMCG","endorsements":"5"},{"name":"Leadership","endorsements":"80"},{"name":"Customer Service","endorsements":"30"},{"name":"Community Building","endorsements":"8"},{"name":"Green Technology","endorsements":"7"},{"name":"Business Model Development","endorsements":"7"},{"name":"New Business Development","endorsements":"35"}],"allSkills":"Marketing Strategy, Management, Start-ups, Business Strategy, Social Media Marketing, Strategy, Marketing Communications, Social Media, Entrepreneurship, Event Management, Business Development, Business Planning, Sales, Online Advertising, SEM, Social Entrepreneurship, FMCG, Leadership, Customer Service, Community Building, Green Technology, Business Model Development, New Business Development"},{"general":{"imgUrl":"https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/C5603AQENCzRV4ICZ8Q/profile-displayphoto-shrink_800_800/0?e=1545264000&v=beta&t=9WurWrJI9ZuWOjht6JJzvhu94CVpouRhs9o24XAK-98","fullName":"Lauren Taylor","headline":"Solicitor at King & Wood Mallesons","company":"King & Wood Mallesons","school":"University of Melbourne","location":"Melbourne, Victoria, Australia","connections":"366","description":"","firstName":"Lauren","lastName":"Taylor"},"jobs":[{"companyName":"King & Wood Mallesons","companyUrl":"https://www.linkedin.com/company/9206/","jobTitle":"Solicitor (Mergers & Acquisitions)","dateRange":"Nov 2017 – Present","location":"Melbourne, Australia","description":null},{"companyName":"King & Wood Mallesons","companyUrl":"https://www.linkedin.com/company/9206/","jobTitle":"Law Graduate","dateRange":"Feb 2017 – Nov 2017","location":null,"description":null}],"schools":[{"schoolUrl":"https://www.linkedin.com/school/10242/?legacySchoolId=10242","schoolName":"University of Melbourne","degree":"Bachelor of Arts (BA)"},{"schoolUrl":"https://www.linkedin.com/school/10242/?legacySchoolId=10242","schoolName":"University of Melbourne","degree":"Juris Doctor of Law"}],"details":{"linkedinProfile":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/lauren-taylor-6744bb108"},"skills":[],"allSkills":""},{"general":{"fullName":"Louise Yun","headline":"Solicitor at King & Wood Mallesons","company":"King & Wood Mallesons","school":"Monash University","location":"Melbourne, Australia","connections":"496","description":"","firstName":"Louise","lastName":"Yun"},"jobs":[{"companyName":"King & Wood Mallesons","companyUrl":"https://www.linkedin.com/company/9206/","jobTitle":"Solicitor","dateRange":"Feb 2017 – Present","location":"Melbourne","description":"Practice areas:\n      \n\n    -
