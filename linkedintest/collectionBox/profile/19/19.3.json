The PhD was completed through SymbioticA, The Centre of Excellence in Biological Arts, School of Anatomy, Physiology and Human Biology, and The Neuroecology Group, School of Animal Biology, The University of Western Australia. The project was supervised by Dr. Ionat Zurr, Professor Shaun P. Collin and Associate Professor Nathan S. Hart.\n\nThe project explored the visual perception of lungfishes, living fossils capable of breathing through air and water, and linked to humans by being the closest living ancestor to all land vertebrates. The unique methodology utilized biological science and visual art, as well as cultural studies that traced the history of human cultural interactions with this significant animal. Scientific data generated through anatomical, electrophysiological and behavioural experimentation contributed to the emerging field of lungfish visual ecology, and artistic research, including 3 public exhibitions, provides a more sensorium speculation of the lungfish visual experience in order to reflect on how we (humans) produce knowledge of non-humans and the limitations of these methods."},{"companyName":"SymbioticA","companyUrl":"https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/index/?keywords=SymbioticA","jobTitle":"Graduate Teaching Assistant (Art)","dateRange":"Feb 2012 鈥� Dec 2013","location":"Perth, Western Australia","description":"Tutor for practical components of the art and science units VISA2214 (Aesthetic\n      Crossovers of Art and Science) and ANHB8511 (Advanced Art and Life Manipulation).\n      Responsible for managing and carrying out tutorial classes, assessments, interactive\n      \n      sessions, and critical feedback for classes of up to 12 students."}],"schools":[{"schoolUrl":"https://www.linkedin.com/school/10239/?legacySchoolId=10239","schoolName":"The University of Western Australia","degree":"Doctor of Philosophy (PhD)","degreeSpec":"Visual Neuroecology and Art","dateRange":"2011 鈥� 2016","description":"PhD Title -Other Worlds: Encounters with the visual perception of lungfishes through science and art."},{"schoolUrl":"https://www.linkedin.com/school/10239/?legacySchoolId=10239","schoolName":"The University of Western Australia","degree":"Bachelor of Science (B.Sc) with Honours (Hons.)","degreeSpec":"Microbiology and Medical Genetics","dateRange":"2006 鈥� 2010"}],"details":{"linkedinProfile":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/audrey-bester-488783104","websites":"audreybester.com"},"skills":[{"name":"Biology","endorsements":"7"},{"name":"Science Communication","endorsements":"8"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","endorsements":"2"},{"name":"Scientific Writing","endorsements":"8"},{"name":"Contemporary Art","endorsements":"2"},{"name":"Visual Arts","endorsements":"4"},{"name":"Curating","endorsements":"1"},{"name":"Writing","endorsements":"3"},{"name":"Curator","endorsements":"1"},{"name":"Research","endorsements":"9"},{"name":"Science","endorsements":"6"},{"name":"Data Analysis","endorsements":"2"},{"name":"Higher Education","endorsements":"3"},{"name":"Life Sciences","endorsements":"1"},{"name":"Academic Writing","endorsements":"0"},{"name":"Art","endorsements":"4"},{"name":"University Teaching","endorsements":"5"},{"name":"Teaching","endorsements":"6"},{"name":"Interdisciplinary Research","endorsements":"3"},{"name":"Visual Ecology","endorsements":"2"},{"name":"Interdisciplinary Teaching","endorsements":"2"},{"name":"Vision Studies","endorsements":"2"},{"name":"Cultural Studies","endorsements":"1"},{"name":"History Of Science","endorsements":"1"}],"allSkills":"Biology, Science Communication, Biological Sciences, Scientific Writing, Contemporary Art, Visual Arts, Curating, Writing, Curator, Research, Science, Data Analysis, Higher Education, Life Sciences, Academic Writing, Art, University Teaching, Teaching, Interdisciplinary Research, Visual Ecology, Interdisciplinary Teaching, Vision Studies, Cultural Studies, History Of Science"},{"general":{"fullName":"Stacey Steele","headline":"Associate Professor at Melbourne Law School","company":"Melbourne Law School","school":"Melbourne Law School","location":"Melbourne, Australia","connections":"500+","description":"An experienced and trusted commercial lawyer specializing in financial services and transactional law.\n \nAs Associate General Counsel at Standard & Poor鈥檚, provide strategic and technical legal advice to the business and support S&P鈥檚 analytical functions.

In this role, I managed all aspects of all the firms鈥� litigation matters.\n\nNotably, in one particular matter I was instrumental in challenging over 100 years of common law affecting property and mortgage laws in New South Wales. Although, we lost at first instance before the Supreme Court of New South Wales, later (on appeal) at the conclusion of the hearing before a full Court of the Supreme Court of Appeal it was evident that our case was going to succeed.\n\nObtaining a positive judgment in the Court of Appeal would result in mortgages on title of properties in New South Wales being open to challenge by non-parties to the contracts and the mortgages. Four of Australia鈥檚 major banks were involved in this case and they settled out of court on the basis that the Court of Appeal would not hand down its judgment. There were 14 parties in total and the Court of Appeal judgment was adjourned 4 times to allow for the settlement to be filed. Needless, to say my clients now enjoy an unencumbered property."},{"companyName":"Regency
