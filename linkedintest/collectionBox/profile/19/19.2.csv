https://www.linkedin.com/in/michael-bromley,"I'm a passionate marketing and content expert with a love for helping firms and owners grow successful businesses. Professionally I've been a lawyer, international recruiter, business owner, podcaster, writer and marketer! I have over 15 years experience advising leading professional services businesses around the world. Starting out as a solicitor at a top tier law firm before moving into recruitment and subsequently Beyond Billables I have been fortunate enough to work with lawyers and firms in over 30 different countries around the world. With Beyond Billables I bring my drive for helping professionals grow their businesses with a love for helping individual owners achieve their ambitions. I am passionate about helping innovative and disruptive firms, legal technology companies, legal services providers and progressive corporations  (and the owners that power them) grow their brand, attract more clients and find success that is meaningful. 

With Maciek I am the co-host of two podcasts, ""The More than Marketing Show"", and the “Beyond Billables” podcasts. 

Outside of work I'm a dedicated father of two and an avid martial artist. I train Brazilian Jiu Jitsu and get to hold my pants up with a purple belt. I also trained Ukidokan kickboxing under Sensei Nadine Champion. I'm a big believer in the importance of health and wellness and am determined to help other professionals find more time to look after themselves. 

For me having a business has to fulfil the vision I have as an owner. I love spending my time helping other like minded owners who want to take their business to the next level do exactly that.",https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/C5603AQGmV0Gw5TmZ3g/profile-displayphoto-shrink_800_800/0?e=1545264000&v=beta&t=lNKaCF2XMzajTQae2xdWnJEDGwgOirut0rCt5Nm9K6Y,Michael,Bromley,Michael Bromley,,Beyond Billables,https://www.linkedin.com/company/18038013/,Co-Founder,"We're career managers and change agents, helping lawyers achieve their goals, in life and at work.

Check out our podcast at https://beyondbillables.com/podcast-for-lawyers/

What doe we do?

* We are building a platform for lawyers to find new roles they love in a #newlaw, legal technology companies, the “gig” economy, progressive firms and companies looking to hire lawyers for non legal roles. 
* We help firms and startups grow by attracting, hiring and retaining the best possible people.
* We provide advice, coaching, content and programs to help lawyers have better lives, better health and better careers. 
* We help friends, friends of friends, and other like minded lawyers who want our personal assistance finding a new role anywhere in the wold. 

The legal profession is rapidly changing and we want to help lawyers better deal with this change and growing firms build amazing businesses. At a macro level new technology like AI, organisational disruption, outsourcing and a change to what it even means to be a lawyer are driving a revolution in legal practice. At a more personal level lawyers are widely unhappy, overworked, unsatisfied and increasingly struggling to balance the rigours of practice with a desire to live a well rounded life.

That's where we come in. Beyond Billables is partnering with firms and startups to bridge the gap between their desire to grow, and their ability to attract, hire and retain the best people. All the while providing a platform for individual lawyers to understand and take advantage of these opportunities, and have healthier and more rewarding careers. 

We've blown up the old model and put partnership, collaboration, growth and the wellbeing at the centre.

We work with the world’s leading law firms. We help the world’s leading lawyers and business services professionals. Ultimately, we bring the two together. 

Do I have options to work overseas? What should I do to position myself for promotion? How do I approach my next review? Can someone provide third party advice at different points of my career? If you’re a lawyer with these questions we should connect and have a confidential chat.  

Do you need the best legal mind for a team with high expectations? Do you want an open, direct and thorough service? Do you have questions about candidate’s skills or experience from a certain jurisdiction but no one to ask? Do you want to know what is happening in the legal market around the world? If you’re a partner or legal professional working at a leading firm we can help.

https://www.linkedin.com/in/dr-tim-macdonald-4470ba92,"Dr MacDonald works primarily at Currumbin Clinic, providing inpatient and outpatient services for his patients, which includes consideration of individual psychotherapy, medication and neuro-stimulation. He is passionate about employing the principles of the ""recovery"" paradigm in mental health care delivery, such as empowerment of the patient in determining both personal and clinical recovery goals, and supported decision making. Some of Dr MacDonald’s specific clinical areas of interests include addiction psychiatry, adult ADHD, mood disorders and psychopharmacology.

He graduated with first class honours through Monash University and with the Geoff Conron Prize in Psychiatry, then trained at The Alfred, Melbourne and St Patrick’s Hospital, Dublin. Dr MacDonald’s curiosity about the interface between medicine and psychiatry led him to train in Consultation-Liaison psychiatry and complete research in the area of conversion disorder. He was an Adjunct Lecturer for Monash University, and has received prizes for writing online learning modules for medical students. He has been actively engaged in tertiary consultation for a number of health services in Melbourne before he moved to the Gold Coast in 2014 where he worked as the Northern Community Clinical Lead for Gold Coast HHS.

As a Consultation-Liaison Psychiatrist, he has become more accustomed to balancing competing interests, collaborating broadly with staff of varying disciplines, understanding how clinical and management staff interact within complex operational systems, and supervising staff of different professional backgrounds. He has an interest in teaching and research, which includes presenting educational topics to clinical and non-clinical staff in an effort to promote mental health literacy in our community.

Traditionally a taboo topic, doctors are increasingly recognising the pitfalls of having little or no knowledge of personal and professional money management, including taxation, investment and business structure.

The group page has been designed to established confidence in the members by closing the group to non-doctors. This allows members to express personal opinions or concerns more freely than may otherwise occur. Members are encouraged to help direct the activities of the group and administrators are guided by the group’s collective voice.

The extension into the Business For Doctors webpage incorporates the development of knowledge in all sectors of business, banking and finance for both individuals and Medical Practitioners.

As a solicitor, I worked in commercial law, with a particular focus on property law but also general commercial litigation. I completed my graduate training at Maddocks Lawyers, and worked there as a solicitor until September 2016. From late 2016 to early 2018, I pursued my interest in academia, designing and teaching units for Legal Writing and Legal Profession & Professional Practice (Legal Ethics) at Swinburne University.  While teaching at Swinburne, I continued my involvement in private practice, working intermittently as a contract lawyer at Allens on a number of document review projects and, more recently, at Coulter Roache Lawyers in Geelong in their property law practice. 

I was awarded a Juris Doctor graduate degree from the University of Melbourne in 2014 and received a Certificate of Academic Excellence on completion. 

Before starting my career in law, I worked in marketing, fundraising and business development in the not-for-profit sector. I worked as a major donor fundraiser for Oxfam Australia and have engaged in marketing and fundraising initiatives for several other not-for-profit organisations as a trainer and consultant.

A hands on CEO at MYOB, I’m focussed on achieving results.  Through my work at MYOB, I love the opportunities provided to drive fantastic outcomes for clients and team members.

My strengths centre on my capability of developing and driving strategy (particularly when marrying technology and business).

Peter Drucker once wrote, “The CEO is the link between the Inside that is ‘the organization,’ and the Outside of society, economy, technology, markets, and customers. Inside there are only costs. Results are only on the outside.”  I really subscribe to this thought.  My job is to form the link or bridge between the Inside and the Outside of MYOB.

I love the journey we are on at MYOB - helping SMEs build stronger businesses by leveraging the internet. From web hosting to online accounting solutions - we have a great opportunity to bring this vision to life and have a big impact on many businesses.

Lloyd has a Bachelor of Arts and Bachelor of Laws from Deakin University. He joined Maurice Blackburn in 2014. Lloyd helps people injured on the roads and at work with WorkCover, TAC and related compensation claims.

“I became a lawyer to achieve justice for those who are often vulnerable and disenfranchised,” says Lloyd.

“I’m inspired to advocate for those members in society who have been injured on the roads or at work to ensure they receive the best possible outcome. The most satisfying part of my job is making a positive difference to my clients’ lives when I settle their claim.”

Lloyd is a keen on- and off-road motorcyclist and supporter of Maurice Blackburn’s Sorry Mate I Didn’t See You (SMIDSY) motorcycle safety campaign.

“Having been exposed to the increased dangers as a motorcyclist and to the many hazards we face on the roads, I am able to empathise with the riders who are injured.

“I have a strong interest in changing policies and laws so they better represent motorcyclists’ interests on the road. Being a road safety lawyer and a rider puts me in a better position to understand the impact of any proposals to design safer roads or legislative changes to enhance road safety.”
