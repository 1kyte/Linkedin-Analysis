For businesses and advisors that see opportunity in everything, Ansarada’s AI powered Material Information Platform illuminates a path from today to what’s next and positions businesses for success. 

We’ve run thousands of deals through our data room product and realised that a business is never better prepared or in better shape than at the end of a material deal, like raising funds or selling. Why wait for a make-or-break event to become aware, prepared and connected to the tools and advice needed be successful?  A material information platform makes it easy to put this wisdom to use in your business today and make what’s next visible and actionable now. 

HOPE IS NOT A STRATEGY, READINESS IS.
We’ve used data and built machine learning and AI tools based off previous deals and best practices from the world’s top companies & advisors. For material events like funding rounds and preparing for raising capital, an audit, licensing deals, through to getting ready for and executing a potential sale, acquisition, tender process or public listing, the ansarada material information platform gets advisors and businesses ready, set and going well. 

MY ROLE AS CEO?
Build a company people love to work for and products that revolutionise business and deal making. 

I study, practice and teach leadership. I challenge the status quo to unlock potential in the people, businesses and communities that I am privileged to serve. We’ve pledged 1 percent of ansarada’s equity, time and product to the Adara Group, a unique organization working to improve the lives of women and children in Nepal and Uganda.

I am a veteran CIO/CTO and business leader who, together with my team, have embarked upon one of the biggest technology enabled business transformations in the organisation’s 150 year history. By embracing a new wave of disruptive technologies we plan to transform the Building and Construction supply markets.

I led a major technology transition at CSR, where the application of world-leading technology and operational excellence is viewed by executive management & Board as a clear point of strategic differentiation.  As a result, CSR IT is delivering world-class digital platforms such as visualisers, external facing sites, CRM, B2B and B2C platforms; more agile IT infrastructure, and is innovating across its technology portfolio, from online self-service customer platforms, to mobile enabled enterprise applications at the construction site, through to developing an industrialised process for integrating M&A’s.  

I am an advocate of open systems, cloud computing and on-demand infrastructure, I am always looking at what opportunities and challenges lay ahead for the industry.  

I am fascinated by trends in social media, mobility and big data especially in the context of global, social and political issues. 

I believe in the generosity of the human spirit – and that as individuals we can make a difference on this planet.

You’ll find her curiosity captivating – so much so that you’ll be well out of your comfort zone before you even realise you were on your way.  You know they say the harder you work the luckier you get? Lisa Stephenson is one of the lucky ones. Lisa knows how to hit the mark. She looks beyond the obvious, peeling apart the layers by asking the right questions at the right time. She makes the connections, builds the relationships, digging deeper and aiming higher.  As the founding Director of Who Am I Projects, Lisa successfully combines accreditations, skills and experience with an incredible sense of curiosity, intuition and compassion. She’s also a diehard 80’s fan (don’t judge), although she doesn’t mind the occasional 90’s rock (and, naturally, is totally obsessed with Adele). 
After starting her career with a Bachelor of Arts in Management Communication and a Certificate IV in Workplace Assessment & Training, Lisa graduated from the renowned Life Coaching Academy. She became driven to combine all three disciplines, guiding and supporting people to be the very best version of themselves, both professionally and personally.

The greatest learning happens in discomfort!

As a keynote speaker, Lisa works across Australia, Asia, N.Z and the U.S.  Setting the challenge for audiences around the world, in understanding you are your most important project.  

Of note, Lisa has developed and managed the highly regarded THRIVE talent development experience for the National Australia Bank over the past 8 years (Australia and Asia), as well as Telstra’s THE DYNAMIC talent development experience, Treasury Wine Estate’s VERAISON program, and Macquarie Bank’s SHINE experience for women in banking. Also of note is the leadership work delivered for Australian Unity.  There lots of work we can that the team can't tell you about! 

Her passion lies in supporting people to be the best version of themselves, and to achieve their best life in a holistic way. She will engage, challenge, inspire, and hold people accountable for going after what they want! People are taken to that higher level of achievement where they will know what they didn’t know before and will start acting on that gap between where they are and where they want to be. They will know more about what success (and happiness) means for them and what they need to do to achieve it.

The concept of Foodbank Queensland is simple – to feed the country’s needy by redistributing surplus food. 

Food growers, manufacturers and processors produce quantities of food which, for various commercial reasons, cannot be sold. The products may be incorrectly labelled, have faulty packaging, be part of a trial run or are not produced to exact specifications. 

It is estimated that as much as 30% of all food produced is unsaleable for a variety of reasons. 

Increasingly, welfare agencies are involved in an on-going struggle to provide food relief to thousands of people who are dependant on food handouts to supplement their welfare benefits. 

Foodbank Queensland is the link between these two groups. Foodbank provides an outlet to food companies for their surplus stock and at the same time, allows community support agencies to save time and resources in the solicitation of nutritious food.

1. Do you want to increase your sales conversions?
2. Do you want to save time, money and/or mental energy from selling?
3. Do you want to improve your lead generation/sales funnel?

If you answered YES to any of the above, I may be able to help.

I help business owners close high-end B2C/B2B products and services over the phone, on a strict 100% performance basis.

How I close is what makes me different.

I connect with pre-qualified prospects on a personal level, lead conversations using proven techniques and philosophies, to help them close themselves on your offering, within 45 minutes.

Through the closing process, I will ensure pre-qualified prospects are the ideal fit for your products and services, truly benefiting from what you do, otherwise they will be disqualified.

At the end of day, it comes down to results, and I am driven to deliver results to my clients.

I am not for everyone.

But we may be able to work together if you:

✓ Are an established coach, influencer, thought leader, authority, or marketer with a solid track record.

✓ Have a high-end program or service with a minimum price of $5000.

✓ Your program or service delivers transformative value to people.

✓ Have a consistent and predictable lead generating system that nurtures qualified leads/prospects.

✓ Are looking for a professional closer and NOT a salesperson, that works on a pure commission basis.

If you could see us being a fit, and is serious about leveraging, I would be happy to set aside sometime to connect with you.

I have recruited for both private and public sector within Accounting & Finance, Sales & Marketing, HR, Communications, Office Support and Rec 2 Rec. After managing a Rec 2 Rec Melbourne branch for over three years and having huge success I decided to launch my own business, R2R Melbourne in 2015.

I have achieved outstanding results so far in my career and have started desks and branches from scratch. I have a proven track record (and a stack of testimonials!)

I pride myself on my relationship management skills, ability to listen and act with a sense of urgency but most importantly my ability to get it right and ensure that top class service is delivered at all times.

Recruiters are always in demand & when you find yourself in the job market looking for a role in recruitment it can be an overwhelming process. Every agency say they have the best database, the best culture and the best commission structure – but remember, you are being sold to by a sales person!! What every recruiter needs is a good, honest and trustworthy R2R. Someone they can meet with and say ‘ this is me, these are my strengths and this is what I want, where is the best place for me?’ That is where I come into things.
 
I have spent a lot of time meeting with most agencies across Melbourne, not only have I met with these agencies, the owners & managers but I have also met with recruiters who work for them, I hear both sides of the stories and trust me, in the recruitment market in Melbourne nothing stays in the dark for long! If there is something untoward or suspicious about an agency OR a recruiter it is very easy to find out.

My opinions to both my clients & candidates is always an open & honest opinion, this is something I absolutely pride myself in.

I have extremely strong relationships with all of my clients & have placed a number of successful recruiters at each client, so I have detailed inside information from both the client & candidate. I have placed Directors, GM’s, BDM’s. account managers, divisional managers, senior consultants & trainee consultants.
