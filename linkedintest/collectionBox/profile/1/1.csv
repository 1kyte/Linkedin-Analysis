So I have skills in Marketing, Sales, Technical and Business. 

I launched Trunked Mobile networks for Motorola, Television NZ and went on to Create and build businesses for Telecom NZ in Cellular mobile data and Vodafone in business Cellular 2.5G GPRS.

Following on from this I created and launched a Business Mobile email service with Optus.

After owning and working in my own small business providing IT network design and support, I joined an international Cellular SIM and SIM subscriber management company, G&D, where I did technical product and sales management.

Since joining CSC and now AT&T I have gained new experience delivering wireless network solutions on mine sites in Western Australia and Queensland.

Recently this has included designing LTE 4G network architectures for industrial users including for a mine site in Laos.

Mobile, Cellular and more recently WLAN technologies has been my industry sector. I have diversified my skills and experience to include Radio and IT components as today's user equipment and services combine both.

I have been pleased and excited to travel the globe both for fun and for work.

https://www.linkedin.com/in/paulinestupavski,"One of my all-time favourite quotes is by Aristotle who said - “We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, then, is not an act, but a habit”. This mindset was at the forefront of my mind when I started my client services career working for Dun & Bradstreet. At D&B I was chosen to service their worldwide internal offices. I relished being thrown into the deep end and quickly learnt that I loved the relationship building side of my role. I liked that I was a part of this niche market and I enjoyed the high pressure atmosphere that involved a combination of: complaint resolution, interpreting highly technical information, dealing with high value clients, training colleagues and being part of an ""ideas generation"" team who tested company software prior to implementation.

This experience led me to OnePath where I was introduced to the world of Insurance in a Case Management role as part of the Underwriting team. I liaised with advisers and clients in a high pressure environment and learned the fundamentals of how the end-to-end retail insurance process works. This was a valuable stepping stone to my current role - Business Development Officer. My BDO role is fast paced, dynamic, energetic and client focused – the areas where I thrive and perform at my best. Advisers come to me as a first point of escalation so I demonstrate high level problem solving skills and am able to think creatively outside of the box. My focus is to deliver a superior level of service and develop relationships with a defined panel of advisers and dealer groups.

https://www.linkedin.com/in/officeleasingsydney,"I have over 35 years’ experience in the Real Estate industry. My first five years covered Residential Real Estate Lettings, Residential Real Estate & Property Management through to Commercial Property Management and Acquisitions as a fund manager.

From 1984 to 1996, I specialised in selling commercial office properties on Sydney’s North Shore. Post 1996, I moved into Office Leasing and built the business m² Office Leasing which controlled ‘Best of the Best’ office stock across the North Shore. I sold this business in 2011.

Forward to today, I am a real estate agent who adds value to the process of finding and introducing businesses to office space in Sydney. I win the right to act for clients who own office buildings, then manage the workload and introduce potential companies to Premium or A Grade office premises and negotiate leases. I was the 2015 winner of the REI NSW Commercial Sales / Leasing award.

In addition I bring new Real Estate work to Knight Frank where I share that work with other specialists within the KF network. In 2014/15 I shared fees with 15 others.

Also I travel each year to major global cities like San Francisco, New York, Singapore, Shanghai and Hong Kong where I am looking to extend my network to build a new channel of business.

My specialisations and interests across Commercial Real Estate and Office Leasing includes:

✔ Commercial Office Leasing 
✔ Office Leasing Specialist 
✔ Office Leasing Major Projects 
✔ Project Marketing
✔ Real Estate 
✔ Valuations and Auctioneer Specialisation
✔ Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors
✔ Real Estate Institute of New South Wales ( NSW )

✔ I am based in Sydney 

✔ we work with the Commercial Office Leasing specialists, Knight Frank

These clients include established Ultra High Net Wealth Individuals with broad based investment property portfolios, Foreign Institutions, Corporations and Australian Property Institutions. The role allows me to assemble expert teams, to specifically meet the needs of those clients.
 
Knight Frank’s business in Australia is broad, encompassing Office, Industrial, Retail and Residential property. This means that I work across all different property functions. Whilst solutions to challenges in different locations can be similar in theory, the value of local knowledge, expertise and connections are all vital. My job is to understand the problem, determine the options, work with the client to agree on the best outcome and then with our specialist people, deliver the best solution. 

Having 22 offices across the country and a dynamic, well connected international network gives me reach. Our research team provides credibility. The Wealth Report and Global Cities Report, both produced annually are world class documents. Our local research is of a very high standard and we do many bespoke jobs as well. Our Asset Management Services business is a large part of the company’s revenue and provides day to day support and a very strong bond with our clients. Our transactions teams market properties and deliver tenants and buyers, as well as the opportunity to act for clients through investigations. Our Project Management and Building Consultancy team is first rate and we can take full control of building challenges and due diligence works.

This new role is huge, particularly across such an established International business. I can make quite a difference to clients by having a big picture view of the market and a small focused view of the solution to their challenge.","Sydney, Australia",Knight Frank Australia,https://www.linkedin.com/company/1625520/,Office Leasing ✔ Office Leasing Specialist ✔ Office Leasing Major Projects ✔ Real Estate ✔ Director,"As Director, Office Leasing Major Projects, I have created a role at the top of the market

Throughout an 18-year career providing HR leadership on a divisional and national level at Woolworths, recent experience leading a significant HR transformation for Valspar and a current focus on building a pioneering People & Culture strategy for retail disruptor, General Pants Co., I’ve built an eclectic and diverse skill set across operating models, professional verticals and in the delivery of challenging mandates. With experience across strategy, change, projects and executive business partnering, I know how to ‘make things happen’ – driving the identification and conversion of opportunities for improvement while carefully managing the risks inherent in any type of change or movement from the status quo.

I’m genuinely interested in people, their careers and their goals. Fascinated by psychology and its intersection with HR and workplace psychology, I know what makes people tick and what makes them recoil, how they will react to change and how to prepare them for it. Because of this, I’m known as an influencer and change agent, able to break the mould and think differently, while maintaining commercial focus and forward momentum.

Beyond this, I seek to empower emerging leaders across the business, building leadership capability and the knowledge of HR best practices to effectively manage commercial situations and improve performance. As a leader, I love to solve tricky situations through the creation of elegant solutions. Whether it be improving employee engagement or creating new strategies across talent, succession planning and recruitment, my ability to innovate and evaluate different perspectives is the key to my success in resolving scenarios that others may find insurmountable.",https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/C5103AQGNYxQxvfgSnw/profile-displayphoto-shrink_800_800/0?e=1545264000&v=beta&t=-NtA2Gyzq9weMQ_3KdV-hVB-pOWcfmRo5_t_yIsXU0E,Alex,Power,Alex Power,,General Pants Co.,https://www.linkedin.com/company/518627/,General Manager HR,"Working with General Pants Co. at an incredibly exciting point in their growth story, my role is to develop and implement a transformative HR roadmap to embed company values across our people ecosystem, support rapid expansion and build a sustainable platform for high performance through best practice HR frameworks.

In my experience of taking over 'dysfunctional' teams, it is more often than not the systems and the processes that hinder the people to do their best work.

There are often many reasons given for this, the economy, the market, competitors, poor weather etc. However most of the time there are more systemic issues predominantly around the people, systems and processes. At HR Lead Consulting we work through a process to uncover these systemic issues, provide tailored solutions and help you work through any problems to get you a better outcome, year on year. 
We are a HR System Specialist and can help you select the right HR Software for your business. We have the most detailed assessment on HR Software providers in the market.

We found Red Appointments and liked them so much that we have partnered with them to bring them to Western Australia. This has enabled HR Lead Consulting to add a high quality service addition to our 'People' service stream offering.

Founded in 2009 by Simon Luhrs and Kerry Pimm, Red Appointments is a privately-owned recruitment company that provides a broad range of workforce recruitment services including permanent recruitment and labour hire.   Our clients include some of Australia’s most respected companies, representing a broad range of industry sectors from construction and industrial, to management and professional services.

We are different to other recruitment firms.  Our strengths lie in our ability to service a broad range of industries, our flexibility to meet tough briefs and our ability to offer a human-resource related advisory service to our clients.

We understand that very often, what our clients want is not an ‘off-the-shelf’ solution, but a well-considered, tailored approach to the provision of human resource.  They want a recruitment agency that can move as fast as they are moving and that can deliver on very specific briefs.","Western Australia, Australia",Charles Sturt University,https://www.linkedin.com/school/10222/?legacySchoolId=10222,Graduate Certificate in Human Resources Management,,Human Resources Management and Services,,Central Queensland University,https://www.linkedin.com/school/10220/?legacySchoolId=10220,Bachelor of Business,,Human Resources Management,2000 – 2003,,,,,,,,,,"Recruiting, Human Resources, Employee Engagement, Performance Management, Change Management, Project Management, Operations Management, Strategic Planning, Policy, Mining, Business Development, Budgets, HR Policies, Recruitment Advertising, Graduate Recruitment, Onboarding, Project Planning, HR Consulting, Budget Administration, Employer Branding, Executive Search, Process Improvement, Policy Interpretation, Operational Management, Talent Recruitment, Occupational Health and Safety, Process Improvements, HRIS, Management, Organizational Development, Interviews, Stakeholder Management, Leadership Development, Leadership, Personnel Management, Executive Coaching, Culture Change, Employee Training, Mentoring, Team Building and Leadership, Organisational Development, Training and Development, Coaching, Remuneration, Employee Retention, International Recruitment, Personnel Selection, Remuneration and Benefits, Roster Development, Diversity Balance Initiatives",Recruiting,95,Human Resources,91,Employee Engagement,90,Performance Management,53,Change Management,52,Project Management,33,https://www.linkedin.com/in/craigbaker72/,craigbaker72,2018-10-20T02:03:16.157Z
