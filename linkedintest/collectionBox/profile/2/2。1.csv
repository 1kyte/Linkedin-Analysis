It is critical that translators research thoroughly on the internet and through other resources available to them to ensure that they are using subject specific language that is also current and widely accepted by the target audience in the LOTE market. As part of this work translators in each language group also compile language-specific technical glossaries and in-house style guides for use of technical and marketing language in different contexts. These items are shared between translators in each language group to ensure that translations are consistent and coherent across BMD content. This research also includes BMD translators contacting and communicating with technical specialists working in fields relevant to the BMD products and participate in online forums where they seek clarification on any areas of uncertainty about language use.

In addition to this, BMD specialist staff such as product managers, engineers etc. run in-house training and product information sessions on a regular basis to BMD translators where they address and clarify product terminology and operation. These specialists are always accessible to translators for any one on one feedback and questions as well. Through these sessions BMD translators build contextual knowledge not just on products but also safety and legal knowledge surrounding the products and the production and broadcast industries.

https://www.linkedin.com/in/samanthagash,"Corporate lawyer turned international endurance athlete, inspirational speaker and social change advocate.  

In my final years as a law student I embraced a 'once in a life time' opportunity to race 250kms in the driest desert in the world - the Atacama Desert in Chile. Despite all of the formal education and experiences I had to this point, it was through the preparation and 6 days of the race that I learnt some of my most invaluable life lessons on resilience, adaptability and bravery. 

 That same year I became the first woman & youngest person to complete the Four Deserts Grandslam - 4 x 250km ultra marathons in the driest, windiest, hottest and coldest deserts on earth. Through this journey I was featured in the award-winning documentary Desert Runners that highlights the need for resilience in immensely challenging situations and hostile surroundings. 

Through exploration of other communities & landscapes all over the world, I have deepened my own understanding of my mental and physical capacities. I have discovered that our capabilities are often beyond our imagination but the power is when we can use the thing we are passionate about, for a purpose outside of ourselves - achieved through collaboration and mindfulness. 

I drew from these experiences in my work as a corporate lawyer and now in my position as a speaker,  endurance athlete, writer & Ambassador for World Vision.  

In 2014, I ran 1968kms across South Africa over 32 day to raise funds and awareness around the high cost and inaccessibility of feminine hygiene products for women in rural South Africa. 
In 2016, I partnered with World Vision on its 50th anniversary for a 3253kms from the west to east of India over 77 days.

Based in the Engineering Department, I had the opportunity to build up the Council¸s environmental program and to work with a great group of people who wanted to make a practical difference.

After some time at Council, I started studying law at night and over weekends and holidays.  I graduated ¸top of my class¸.  But after over 12 years at Council, it was time to pursue a legal career.

I now have over 15 years of experience in the rail, energy and resources and government sectors.  I¸ve had a significant focus on rail and linear transport infrastructure including regulated access, safety, leasing, tenure and land access and related mining and petroleum compensation and access arrangements.

However, I¸m more than just a ¸rail lawyer¸.  I¸ve undertaken secondments at various State Government Departments, Vale and Aurizon Network Pty Ltd.  I¸ve advised on various other types of matters ¸ e.g. GOC c e.g. GOC competitive neutrality, licencing arrangements for 2001: A Space Odyssey, sugar sales, co-mingling and storage agreements, a hospital energy facility BOOT arrangement, indoor cricket affiliation and sponsorship agreements, harbour and premise leasing, CSO agreements and resumption issues, just to name a few.

My move from the Energy Resources and Projects group at Corrs to the Intellectual Property, Technology and Competition group in recent years has expanded my horizons ®π exposing me to a broader competition law practice and issues such as privacy, telecommunications, AI and robotics.  However, I haven't seen practice groups as work silos, as I've often had the chance to work for, and with, other partners and groups.

https://www.linkedin.com/in/chellemcquaid,"My name is Michelle McQuaid, and I'm a best-selling author, workplace wellbeing teacher and playful change activator. With more than a decade of senior leadership experience in large organizations around the world, I'm passionate about translating cutting-edge research from positive psychology and neuroscience, into practical strategies for growth, wellbeing, and business success. 

Your primary source of business productivity is a team of engaged, motivated, healthy employees who genuinely care for your customers, support their colleagues, and add real value to your stakeholders.  Furthermore, employees who learn how to bring out the best in themselves find their goals easier to achieve, get better performance reviews, find more meaning in their work and are less likely to burn out.

I hold a Masters in Applied Positive Psychology from the University of Pennsylvania and am an honorary fellow at Melbourne University¸s Graduate School of Education, and because I believe that playfulness is essential for growth, everything I deliver is designed to share serious knowledge and skills in a playful way that accelerates learning and make changes so enjoyable they last.

My books, training programs, coaching sessions and talks have already helped thousands of people make work more rewarding, and my blend of real-world successes, actionable advice and enthusiasm are why I'm sought out by audiences around the world at organizations that include PwC, IBM, GlaxoSmithKline, the Australian Grand Prix, National Australia Bank, MLC Insurance, Treasury Wine Estates, the Australian Human Resources Institute, Ravenswood Girls School, the VIA Institute and many more. 

I live to help people discover their strengths, move beyond their fears, and finally discover what it truly takes to flourish with confidence. Let me show you how.

My professional HR career started back in 2004, when fresh out of university with my Bachelor of Arts majoring in HR and Psychology, I joined one of the country¸s largest entertainment companies.  At Strike Entertainment, I worked in corporate sales and event management.

International professional opportunities called me in 2006, and after touring Europe for a number of months, I assumed the position of Communications Event Coordinator with ABN Amro in London.  From here, I took on an event coordination role with Goldman Sachs and from there, I moved back to ABN Amro to fill the position of EA/Junior Business Manager.  

In September 2007, upon returning to Australia, I accepted the position of HR Administrator at Deacons (known as Norton Rose).  

From here, my HR career took me to another legal firm (known as King & Wood Mallesons) where I worked in a predominantly Organisational and Capability Development role (O&CD).  It was a role I stayed in until May 2010, when I joined the ranks of national firm, Maurice Blackburn Lawyers.  I started out as a Human Resources Consultant, and was promoted twice until I assumed the role of Victorian Human Resource Manager. 

IIn 2013, I moved into a small HR consulting business, fibreHR, who's main aim is to support small to medium size businesses with all things HR. 

In January 2016, I made a lifestyle change and moved to Darwin and commenced my role as HR Manager for NT, WA and SA for the national firm, Maurice Blackburn. 

In August 2018, I relocated to the sunny location of the Gold Coast and commenced in a newly created position within Maurice Blackburn, being the National Talent Manager.

As an Author, I have loved writing and publishing two books in the Universal Life Lessons' series:

Universal Life Lessons:  My Brilliant Blue Bohemian Butterfly - (published August 2015)  - which tells the story of my youngest daughter's remarkable and courageous journey to live a full and happy life.  It gives hope to others that, no matter what their circumstances, they can live a good life if they apply the universal life lessons.

Universal Life Lessons:  Gift of Your Greatness - (published September 2016) - shares people's stories that give hope that through adversity comes strength and stamina and the ability to achieve great things.  Chapters include information regarding the Seventeen Sustainable Development Goals so that we can contribute to the UN's 2030 agenda for world peace and harmony; and to protect the planet.  The book is dedicated to Martha Farrell who was killed by the Taliban in May 2015 and a percentage of the proceeds goes to the Martha Farrell Foundation to continue her work in gender equality.

My practice has focused on transport infrastructure, innovative land use and project development. I also advise on all aspects of building and construction for large-scale mixed-use developments (including advising on the transactions documents usually associated with these types of developments) and large commercial transactions. I have extensive experience in finding solutions for the integration and connectivity of residential, commercial and mixed-use developments.

I am highly experienced in preparing innovative structures for joint ventures both with public bodies and in the private sector, including the provision of urban renewal projects. I also have considerable expertise in all areas of rail transport infrastructure, including transit-oriented developments. Additionally, I advise offshore, national and local develolopers of residential and mixed-use precincts, retail shopping centres and luxury resorts, and lead negotiations between stakeholders and key players on multi-party transactions.

I have experience in dispute resolution processes and procedures and am often called upon by my clients to negotiate commercial outcomes rather than turning to full-scale litigation.

- Divorce

Prior to working at Butlers, I gained experience clerking at family law firms and volunteering at Law Access.

Disclaimer: I cannot stand bio's written in third person but I also cannot be bothered re-writing this bio that was written for me for a conference, so let's do this:

¸Gretta van Riel is one of Australia¸s top young serial entrepreneurs. 

With 5 multi-million dollar startups under her belt, Gretta prides herself on turning audiences into brands and trends into markets. 

She loves to hack a social media algorithm with over 16 million followers on Instagram, over 5.8M impressions a month on Pinterest and 2.6M views of her content on LinkedIn in 10 days. She once grew an Instagram account from 0-48,500 followers in a day. 

Gretta founded her first startup, SkinnyMe Tea (SMT), at the age of 22 with $24 in the bank. SMT went on to be a global success going on to win the Shopify Build-A-Business competition in 2013. Five years on, SMT has now  sold over 11 million cups of tea worldwide and helped their customers lose a combined 1.5M kgs.

Gretta later went on to co-create The 5THTH Watches (www.the5th.co), which achieved over $100k in revenue on it®πs first day of sales, and $1M in a single day of sales. Gretta exited The 5TH in late 2017.

More recently, Gretta has shifted her focus from eComm to tech. 

Leveraging her extensive knowledge of the influencer marketing landscape as both a brand and an influencer Gretta launched her Influencer Marketing platform  Hey Influencers. 

Hey Influencers is an Influencer Relationship Management (IRM) and campaign creation platform helping to connect and cultivate relationships between brands and social media influencers.®π
