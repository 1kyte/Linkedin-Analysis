As part of this work translators in each language group also compile language-specific technical glossaries and in-house style guides for use of technical and marketing language in different contexts. These items are shared between translators in each language group to ensure that translations are consistent and coherent across BMD content. This research also includes BMD translators contacting and communicating with technical specialists working in fields relevant to the BMD products and participate in online forums where they seek clarification on any areas of uncertainty about language use.\n\nIn addition to this, BMD specialist staff such as product managers, engineers etc. run in-house training and product information sessions on a regular basis to BMD translators where they address and clarify product terminology and operation. These specialists are always accessible to translators for any one on one feedback and questions as well. Through these sessions BMD translators build contextual knowledge not just on products but also safety and legal knowledge surrounding the products and the production and broadcast industries.\n\nCommonly translated materials include but are not limited to:\n•\tAdvertisements (print and internet)\n•\tSubtitling\n•\tProduct user manuals\n•\tProduct web content\n•\tPress releases\n•\tTweets / tiles / Facebook / product descriptions\n•\tUser interfaces / localisation for hardware and software\n•\tLegal translations\n•\tProduct technical specifications\n•\tOther marketing material \n•\tMessages and official company emails from the CEO \n•\tTrade show contents (banners, postcards, wall text etc.)\n•\tCompany product catalogue"},{"companyName":"4tets Rare Books","companyUrl":"https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/index/?keywords=4tets%20Rare%20Books","jobTitle":"Publishing Projects Curator","dateRange":"Mar 2009 – Present","location":"Worldwide","description":"Managing and directing of the publishing projects.

After all, the failure rate for most in making life changes, like getting fit, losing weight and conquering stress is 90% or more. So how is it that some succeed and some don't? \n\nSo we studied those that have succeeded, years of scientific research and ancient spiritual wisdom to work out that there is actually a formula to these successes. We also found out that most people fail because they don't know what their formula for success is and they only ever employ a few parts of this formula  - plus people struggle to find the time and keep it up. \n\nSo iWithin helps you make the changes in your life that matter most to you by helping you work out your winning formula and helping you fit it in and keep it up in our busy and

My first fulltime job was at Logan City Council as its initial Environment Officer.  Based in the Engineering Department, I had the opportunity to build up the Council’s environmental program and to work with a great group of people who wanted to make a practical difference.\n\nAfter some time at Council, I started studying law at night and over weekends and holidays.  I graduated ‘top of my class’.  But after over 12 years at Council, it was time to pursue a legal career.\n\nI now have over 15 years of experience in the rail, energy and resources and government sectors.  I’ve had a significant focus on rail and linear transport infrastructure including regulated access, safety, leasing, tenure and land access and related mining and petroleum compensation and access arrangements.\n\nHowever, I’m more than just a “rail lawyer”.  I’ve undertaken secondments at various State Government Departments, Vale and Aurizon Network Pty Ltd.  I’ve advised on various other types of matters – e.g. GOC competitive neutrality, licencing arrangements for 2001: A Space Odyssey, sugar sales, co-mingling and storage agreements, a hospital energy facility BOOT arrangement, indoor cricket affiliation and sponsorship agreements, harbour and premise leasing, CSO agreements and resumption issues, just to name a few.\n\nMy move from the Energy Resources and Projects group at Corrs to the Intellectual Property, Technology and Competition group in recent years has expanded my horizons – exposing me to a broader competition law practice and issues such as privacy, telecommunications, AI and robotics.  However, I haven't seen practice groups as work silos, as I've often had the chance to work for, and with, other partners and groups.\n\nWhile I’ve always been interested in science fiction and what the future might hold, my head isn’t in the clouds.

Australia","connections":"500+","description":"One thing that highly successful organisations have in common is the way they work together with their people, to bring about positive outcomes.  \n\nMy professional HR career started back in 2004, when fresh out of university with my Bachelor of Arts majoring in HR and Psychology, I joined one of the country’s largest entertainment companies.  At Strike Entertainment, I worked in corporate sales and event management.\n\nInternational professional opportunities called me in 2006, and after touring Europe for a number of months, I assumed the position of Communications Event Coordinator with ABN Amro in London.  From here, I took on an event coordination role with Goldman Sachs and from there, I moved back to ABN Amro to fill the position of EA/Junior Business Manager.  \n\nIn September 2007, upon returning to Australia, I accepted the position of HR Administrator at Deacons (known as Norton Rose).  \n\nFrom here, my HR career took me to another legal firm (known as King & Wood Mallesons) where I worked in a predominantly Organisational and Capability Development role (O&CD).  It was a role I stayed in until May 2010, when I joined the ranks of national firm, Maurice Blackburn Lawyers.  I started out as a Human Resources Consultant, and was promoted twice until I assumed the role of Victorian Human Resource Manager. \n\nIn 2013, I moved into a small HR consulting business, fibreHR, who's main aim is to support small to medium size businesses with all things HR. \n\nIn January 2016, I made a lifestyle change and moved to Darwin and commenced my role as HR Manager for NT, WA and SA for the national firm, Maurice Blackburn. \n\nIn August 2018, I relocated to the sunny location of the Gold Coast and commenced in a newly created position within Maurice Blackburn, being the National Talent Manager.
