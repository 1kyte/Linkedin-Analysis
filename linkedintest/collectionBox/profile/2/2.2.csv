I typically work company-side or with investors at key inflection points in a business' lifecycle,either by reason of litigation or a need to restructure operations.  We take the tricky points, and look outside of conventional litigation.

Most of our clients operate in financial services or resources (or are exposed to those industries). 

Before joining QE, I was a litigation and restructuring lawyer with Baker & McKenzie (the world's largest law firm), and, earlier, was the Associate to the Honourable Justice M J Beazley AO, on the NSW Court of Appeal (now President of the NSW Court of Appeal, the highest appellate court in the State).  

In terms of my aptitude; I took a number of firsts at university Law, and was a scholarship recipient in Commerce; I was ranked 6th nationally in the ARITA M1 Insolvency Course; and I was a founding board member on the Turnaround Management Association's NextGen Sydney Committee.

At home; I am the proud husband of an award winning dress designer and e-tailer (Bridesmaids Only), a North Bondi local, connoisseur of the finer things, and father of a master-excavator (our dog, Teddy) and our newest addition - our daughter, Ava.

• corporate and acquisition finance; 
• real estate and construction/development finance; and
• debt restructuring and corporate turnaround.

I have practised in Sydney, London and Milan, acting for many leading banks, debt funds, property funds, sponsors and other corporates in connection with their finance and restructuring needs.  I advise across a wide range of industries including agribusiness, retail, healthcare, construction and technology/start up businesses.  

Growing up in a family business and having invested time on secondment with a number of international investment banks, I understand the importance of customer satisfaction and I am responsive and empathetic to my clients needs.  My particular technical expertise includes drafting, negotiating/structuring and advising on:

• loan agreements (syndicated, club and bilateral);
• intercreditor arrangements, tripartite agreements and security documents; and
• standstill/forbearance arrangements and strategic turnaround activities.

A few examples of recent transactions I have acted on include advising:

• an Australian bank on a secured loan to a borrower for the acquisition and refinance of over 100 social and affordable housing units;

• a syndicate of banks on a secured loan facility to a borrowing group for corporate and working cap purposes in connection with its agri business; 

• a construction and development company on establishing a number of debt funds to invest in, and leverage returns on, its developments in the ACT and SA;

• a foreign investment bank on a senior secured loan to assist with the restructure of an Australian mining group; and

To take the mental health and wellness discussion from talk to action.

MY OBJECTIVE:
To provide honest and thought-provoking mental health awareness, through opening up a safe space for people to reflect and work towards better. 

ME: 
I just want to help people.",,Ian,McCallum,Ian McCallum,,MIRA Consulting,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/index/?keywords=MIRA%20Consulting,MIRA Consulting - Founder,"MIRA Consulting is taking mental health awareness and strategies from talk to action. Awareness is as high as ever, however the number of suicides and attempts remain at the same level.

Through an easy and safe presentation style, we will laugh, cry and take some time out to reflect. I have learnt that everyone has a back story and getting this out is hard. Hard for the person and hard for those asking the questions. 

Whilst organisations have EAP, partnerships with geat organisations like Black Dog and Beyond Blue, often people either don't know they need help or they are scared of the stigma attached.

My presentations help break through this in a safe and respectful environment, so that team members feel empowered to pick up the phone or talk to a mate. I provide some very simple and useful ways to assist and you will leave having learnt something about yourself - that I can promise.","Brisbane, Australia",Virgin Australia,https://www.linkedin.com/company/10400/,General Manager Group Reward,"Due to the creation of a second Board requiring support and advice, my role shifted to a pure reward focus.
Lead role for the Virgin Australia Group’s remuneration function. This was a highly strategic role with a key accountability of Executive Reward which spanned across two Boards for the Virgin Australia Holdings Board  and the Velocity Frequent Flyer Board. Both Boards required extensive support and advice in all areas of  Executive Remuneration and ASX governance.
I worked closely with the Chairman and Chair of the Remuneration Committee for each Board to develop, implement, review and report on all Executive reward strategies. This included the areas of: Group Scorecard and Performance Metrics, Short and Long Term Incentive design, Board Paper preparation and submission and ASX reporting, including Remuneration Report preparation and submission.
I worked closely with the Company Secretary, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Legal Officer and the Group’s external auditing and legal teams.

https://www.linkedin.com/in/lynneschinella,"The greatest cause of stress in the workplace is other people. But you know that.

I work with diverse teams  and show them how to leverage their differences to work more effectively with less stress and greater productivity. Which ultimately means a fatter bottom line.

When I had an incentive business I found that the most successful teams where those that embraced their diversity. So when I established Ripe Learning, this was the foundation on which I built my work to help people and organisations thrive. I love this stuff.

I developed a profiling tool that I use in my keynotes and workshops. And because it’s been so successful, I wrote a book. Bite Me! Who would have thought?
 
Its success lies in its simplicity and blameless language. Everything I do is about how to work, communicate and get the best out of people different to ourselves.  

I believe so wholly in the power we have as leaders, to influence the people around us. It’s our responsibility to bring out the best in them.  Which is why for over ten years I've not only developed and delivered tools and programmes to help people work better together, I've been teaching leaders to find the influential and impactful communicator within.

Having been a reluctant public speaker myself, I want to share what I’ve learned so you can lead with confidence and authenticity.

How can you resist? If you think I can help please email me at lynne@lynneschinella.com.au.
