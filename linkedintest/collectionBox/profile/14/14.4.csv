https://www.linkedin.com/in/ralph-carr-3a44ab29,"With a 25-year history in the entertainment industry, Ralph Carrs credentials and ability speak for themselves.
With groundbreaking success as a business manager, independent publisher, tour promoter,  it is no surprise that Carr is one of the most sought-after pioneers in the industry.
Known for his no-nonsense approach, Ralph has been instrumental in the careers of many of Australia's most successful artists, entertainers, celebrities and sporting personalities including Tina Arena, Vanessa Amorosi, Richard Wilkins, Mark Vincent and Dustin Martin.
RCM Artists have achieved an astronomical level of success under Ralphs guidance that include numerous ARIA awards including Best Australian Adult Contemporary Record, Best Australian Single, Song of the Year, Highest Selling Australian Album, Highest Selling Australian Single and 11 number one ARIAs for albums and singles. 
In mid-2008, three RCM clients held a position in the Australian national Top 10 album charts in the same week; a feat never before achieved by an Australian management company.
In recent years Carr moved into Sport Management with RCM Sport. 
His client list includes prestigious players Dustin Martin (Richmond Football Club), Nick Haynes (Greater Western Sydney) and Shai Bolton (Richmond Football Club). 
Nothing could demonstrate Carrs prowess in this field more than in his work with Dustin Martin, negotiating a record-breaking contract extension combined with an incredible year for the player, made Dustin one of the most successful players in the history of the AFL.
The creation of RCM Touring saw the industry icon add to his already impressive repertoire, building a team of passionate accomplished concert promoters. 
Whether a national arena tour, an intimate show or exhibition, the extensive experience Ralph brings with him to each project is crucial.

Just a quick note letting you all know that I have joined up with a good bunch of blokes who have sold their share in a larger cleaning company to start up an exciting company called Command 51.   

Command 51 offers cleaning, gardening and security services to the education, hospitality and commercial industries and at present we clean the Jimmy Grants and Hellenic restaurants in Melbourne. Further to that, Command 51 does all of the gardening for Hungry Jacks in NSW and on a daily basis clean over 100 sites from Brisbane, Sydney to Melbourne and everywhere in between. The main thing that sets Command 51 apart from most other service providers is the accountability that the team pride themselves on. Every venue that Command 51 services, regardless if it's cleaning, security or grounds has a client service manage allocated to look after that client, and it's that CSM's job to visit the site once a week and be contactable 7 days a week to make sure that the service that the client is paying for is delivered. That's where I slot in.

So if any of you know anybody  that is sick of not being able to contact their cleaners or gardeners or just want to make sure that they are paying the right price, please let me know and I will gladly give them a buzz to see how I can help them out.
