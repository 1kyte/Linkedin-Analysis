As CEO and Co-Founder she shows that there is a business imperative to cultural inclusion - MindTribes works with Australian and MNC's to culturally align staff and tracks performance improvement across 12 months.  Div is also the Co-Founder of CDW (Culturally Diverse Women) a social enterprise working to advance culturally different corporate women.  Div has a personal touchpoint with this both struggling and thriving with her cultural and gender diversity.  

Prior to founding she spent 14 years in People and Culture roles in the BPO industry working across South Africa, Malaysia, Australia, India and The Philippines.  She has authentically and successfully transformed her brand from a senior employee to a CEO and Co-Founder of a business that has gone from idea to execution to commercialisation.  She also has a strong social justice approach, giving 10% of revenue to Plan International's Because I am a Girl campaign.  MindTribes is a Plan International Ambassador.

Her most recent appointment to the Board of STREAT is a culmination of her passion for youth, access to food, employability and the large number of refugees and migrants who find themselves in this plight.

Connecting Cultures. Aligning Performance.  

MindTribes works with both Australian and Multinational corporates to improve business results by culturally aligning staff to internal and external customers, team members and stakeholders.   This means working from a job centric view to accelerate competence when working in a foreign climate.  We ask the question, what do you need to do differently to buy, sell, service, negotiate and manage in a culturally different environment?  We have found that corporates who don’t invest in growing cultural competence suffer unrealised sales, low customer satisfaction metrics, staff turnover and poor integration.

Our differentiator is that we don’t just focus on cultural training.  We focus on operational and business performance when two or more foreign climates come together.  There is no other company that can track business improvement through cultural alignment.  

Our markets are offshored contact centres, shared services and inbound expatriates.

https://www.linkedin.com/in/jwinning,"Upon completion of high school I entered straight into the workforce, and after trying a few things I joined my family's 108-year-old business Winning Appliances. After a short time working in sales and deliveries, I saw an opportunity to sell appliances and whitegoods online. Some tough conversations with management at Winning Appliances followed, who weren't convinced about the potential power of selling goods online. Subsequently, I set up www.appliancesonline.com.au as a pure play online retailer in 2005. 

The learning curve has been exponential and we have cemented our position as an award-winning online retailer, providing a platform where Australians feel comfortable buying large one-off items online without setting foot into a physical store. Our business has grown to employ over 500 staff, with our head-office in Redfern, Sydney and warehouses established in most states. 
Appliances Online is now Australia’s largest online retailer of appliances, delivering to 95% of the population and stocking more brands than any other online appliance retailer. Between 2005 and 2014 more than 400,000 unique customers have purchased from our company. We have also embraced social media and our Facebook community is larger than 335,000 (and growing every day). I was very proud to since be asked by my family to take over the running of my family's business.

The main similarity between Appliances Online and Winning Appliances is that our aim is to impress every customer. We want to provide the customer with a fantastic experience so they come back to buy from us again and again. Our mission is to provide the best shopping experience in the world. Our strengths include online marketing, SEO, SEM, technology, distribution, sales, business development, innovation and extreme customer service. As the company grows so do my goals for what I want to be doing online and as such we have picked up and started a few complimentary customer experience focused businesses along the way.",https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/C4E03AQFpO4YJzNayDw/profile-displayphoto-shrink_800_800/0?e=1545264000&v=beta&t=73SwwOPoap8ZEFTjv-8w_ECHp_gs41EnmbGQYEm_f1A,John,Winning,John Winning,,Winning Group,https://www.linkedin.com/company/754573/,Chief Executive Officer,,Australia,Winning Group,https://www.linkedin.com/company/754573/,Founder and CEO,,"Sydney, Australia",The Scots College,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/index/?keywords=The%20Scots%20College,,,,1989 – 2001,Vaucluse Public School,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/index/?keywords=Vaucluse%20Public%20School,,,,1987 – 1990,,,,,,,,,,"E-commerce, Management, Sales, Business Development, Online Marketing, SEO, Social Media, Direct Marketing, Online Advertising, Business Strategy, SEM, Retail, Business Planning, Social Media Marketing, Search Engine Optimization (SEO), Digital Marketing, Account Management, Web Analytics, Branding & Identity, Strategic Planning, Web Design, Mobile Marketing, PPC, Product Development, Web Development, Search Engine Marketing (SEM), SMO, Product Marketing, Conversion Optimization, Purchasing, Multi-channel Retail, Sponsorship, Digital Media, Product Management, Mobile Devices, Facebook, Google Analytics, Google Adwords, Microsoft Word, Leadership, Customer Service, Time Management, Customer Engagement, Lead Generation, Team Management, New Business Development, Selling",E-commerce,99+,Management,99+,https://www.linkedin.com/in/jwinning/,jwinning,2018-10-20T07:48:52.240Z,Sales,99+,Business Development,99+,Online Marketing,78,SEO,73

I also had input into some design aspects to better cater for my wholesale clientele which was a slightly different demographic to Langhems' online clientele.

within the first 8 months I had 130+ Australian clients (60% were new clients that I had not worked with before) as well as high profile clients in the US and UAE. 

In this role I attended:

Vince’s parents came to Australia with nothing ready to build a new life after the Vietnam War. Growing up in this hardworking household, Vince and his nine siblings all follow paths of startups and entrepreneurship.

After completing a degree in banking and finance / international trade, he felt the pull of being his own boss and launched Allure Bathrooms, a retail bathroom supplier from his garage. While Allure’s beginnings were humble, in just four years the company now turns over $12 million a year, has 35 employees and four mega showrooms with plans to go franchise early next year. Vince’s second business, Nordik Living, is an online venture offering affordable Scandinavian style furniture to the masses.

As with any startup, it hasn’t been smooth sailing for Vince. He has experienced the frustration of being short on staff when demands were high. There’s no pause button for business, so Vince knows Weploy will offer recruitment solutions he and so many other employers are looking for.

https://www.linkedin.com/in/hugorobinson,"The future is coming; people are seeking more flexible employment opportunities so they can live balanced and empowered lives, and businesses are striving to scale faster and more aggressively. By 2020, the Australian workforce will be comprised of 40% contingent staff, with a vast majority undertaking this mode of work by choice.

What is Weploy?
What we do is simple; We connect businesses to pre-vetted staff in under a minute. All Weployees complete 6 rounds of vetting, including psychometric, cognitive and personality profiling, before they are onboarded into our community.
Accessing this community means companies can solve efficiency problems to prioritise high-value tasks, innovate through technology enablement, and have agility around supply - the capacity to flex teams up and down based on business requirements.

What do I do?
I work closely with business leaders to unlock productivity blockers and enable them to execute on their strategies. Being able to focus 100% on mission-critical tasks and project elements increases productivity and drives better outcomes.

Personally, I'm a huge sports fan (go Cats!), miss the Perth coastline but love the Melbourne hustle, and have a keen interest in technology that will positively impact humanity.
I'm also a huge brekky fiend and am on a mission to find Melbourne's best Chilli Scramble - hit me up if there's anywhere I should be going!

https://www.linkedin.com/in/mosesxu,"I completed my PhD from the School of Computer Science and Engineering, UNSW in Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP) in August 2016. My research has a strong focus on applying Machined Learning techniques to Text Mining, and I’m especially interested in knowledge discovery from large-scale social networks where rich textual contents and complex social interactions co-exist, and in understanding how a synergetic approach leveraging both contents and link structures can facilitate the mining of knowledge. Statistical modelling and data analysis are also among my research interests.

I worked as a Data Scientist during my PhD candidature on two ARC-linkage projects in areas of Epidemiology and Criminology, with my main responsibilities covering data crunching, analysis and visualisation. This interdisciplinary research experience compliments my knowledge in Computer Science. The unique opportunity to collaborate with people from different fields with distinct patterns of thinking and ways of approaching problems helped me became a sharp thinker and a highly effective communicator. Besides my main responsibilities, I have also contributed to research designs and strategic decision makings.

In March 2015 I joined Macquarie Bank to work on a revolutionary initiative that aims to provide on-demand investment advice that is highly customised to each user's unique circumstances. Ten months later, this vision to democratise investment advice and make investing as uncomplicated as buying a meal became a reality — the much celebrated OwnersAdvisory platform.

Spaceship offers managed fund products to Australian residents and is the promoter of the Spaceship superannuation product (currently issued by Tidswell Financial Services Ltd). Spaceship's superannuation product was released in January 2017 and now has over $228m in assets under management (AUM) (as at 30-Sep-2018).

Spaceship’s new Voyager product, released in April 2018, aims to help make investing in a diversified portfolio simple, convenient and affordable and is brought together in one beautifully designed app. With Voyager, customers can choose to invest in the Spaceship Index Portfolio, a low-cost market index fund, or the Spaceship Universe Portfolio, which is a portfolio of eligible securities carefully selected by Spaceship's investment team. Voyager has no minimum investment, no brokerage costs and is free for balances below $5,000. For balances above that, Voyager has total fees of between 0.05% to 0.10% per year.
