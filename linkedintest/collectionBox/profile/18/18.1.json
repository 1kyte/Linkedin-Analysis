With the NSW Government's clear policy desire to further increase housing supply in Sydney and to provide the associated critical infrastructure to accommodate future population growth, there is a pressing need to ensure new development does not result in the loss of, or damage to, culturally and historically significant places. I am passionate to use my Local Council DA planning experience & knowledge in the effort to protect and manage culturally significant places for the sake of future generations. I also believe the amenity of our local communities, and the sense of belonging to them, can be improved and enhanced through high quality heritage conservation practice."},{"schoolUrl":"https://www.linkedin.com/school/10245/?legacySchoolId=10245","schoolName":"UNSW Australia","degree":"Bachelor of Planning (Honours Class 1)","degreeSpec":"Urban and environmental planning, statutory and strategic spatial planning, land economics","dateRange":"2007 – 2011","description":"Honours' year thesis undertook a critique of the Metropolitan Plan for Sydney 2036.
