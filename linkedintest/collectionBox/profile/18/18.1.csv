I like the stimulation offered by high pressure environments and am currently building my legal skillset working as a paralegal in insurance and corporate law.

In my pursuit of self-improvement, I have come to know myself more intently. I strive to continuously harness this awareness, which encompasses my weaknesses, gifts, distractions and motivations, to more astutely pursue and accomplish all that I feel called to. 

I care about people and I am deeply relational. I want to leave the world having made a meaningful contribution to the lives of others and so I seek to create a life of purpose in all I do. 

My passions include writing music and mental health advocacy. I consider myself to be highly articulate, fiercely determined and profoundly analytical. I pride myself on my ability to connect to other people through empathy and vulnerability. My affinity with language is evident in my tendency to express myself through words.

I have conducted extensive case and ruling research and analysis, both in domestic and international jurisdictions (ITAA's, TAA's, TRs, GSTRs, OECD BEPS and the Model Tax Convention). From this research, I created a number of reference documents for statutory time limits, out-of-time objections, powers of the Commissioner in respect of statutory notes, and presentation documents for R&D and MAAL disputes. 

I have been extensively involved along the dispute continuum, from Client Risk Reviews, through to large scale Audit activity, as well as litigation. This has involved the drafting of responses to the ATO, submissions in respect of voluntary disclosures and penalties and interest, independent evidence review and regular liaising with clients to assist and better guide them through the process. 

Administratively, I have also been largely responsible for the ensuring compliance with firm-wide engagement and risk processes and protocols, as well as organisation of Continuing Professional Development sessions for our national team and the hosting of our national team teleconferences.

I'm passionate about a legal career. Taxation, Property, Insolvency and Technology are areas I aspire to practice in the future.

While completing my studies, I have gained experience at Deloitte in the Tax Insights & Policy and Indirect Tax service lines. My internship at the Australian Pro Bono Centre has developed my legal research and knowledge of social justice community programs.

I currently study Information Technology at UNSW, because I believe having technical literacy is essential in the success of any business. I'd describe myself as incredibly high-achieving and always willing to give things a go, because you gotta be in it to win it! I love tackling new problems and learning from them as a result. 

Outside of all that academic and career stuff, I love getting involved in university life - particularly societies and case competitions. Having an active role in the community has always helped me feel accomplished that I'm giving back to society. Beyond that, in my free time, I like to make YouTube videos on beauty, fashion and lifestyle to relax and share my non-work passions!
