I have been working in the field of immigration since 2005 providing high-level legal advice to individuals as well as corporations. In 2008, I became the first immigration professional in the world to hold a license to practice in both Australia and New Zealand. My expertise in Australian and New Zealand migration matters includes but is not limited to temporary and permanent employer sponsored visas, general skilled migration, partner, parent, visitor, resident return and citizenship applications.

During my time in the profession, I have assisted thousands of individuals from more than 70 different nationalities and advised some of the most prominent corporate entities in Australia directly on employee eligibility, sponsorship obligations and compliance.

As a well-known and senior practitioner in this field, I place a great deal of emphasis on productive networking and on using my knowledge and experience to further the standing of the profession as a whole. I am the most prolific contributor to the MIA Forum for Registered Migration Agents since its inception in 2002 and am frequently contacted by fellow agents for advice, guidance and mentoring. I also deliver Continuing Professional Development (CPD) to my peers on various different visas through the MIA.

I have been a member of Migration Institute of Australia (MIA) since 2007 and am currently the President of the Victoria and Tasmania Branch, having been elected in 2015 and then again in 2017 with an increased majority. As Branch President, I serve as a Director on the Board of the MIA.

I take a keen interest in multicultural affairs and matters concerning the profession at large. Between 2010 and 2012, I successfully and single-handedly lobbied the Immigration Advisers Authority (IAA) in New Zealand to adopt a Māori name as well as institute a standard Māori term for 'Licensed Immigration Adviser'.",https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/C4E03AQGiBcAhvTdMZg/profile-displayphoto-shrink_800_800/0?e=1545264000&v=beta&t=oFyk_aRulEiAuILn3u0WUWxKeZ14UclLu9C9Xw_K-DM,Anka,Sahin,Anka Sahin,,True Blue Migration,https://www.linkedin.com/company/7730670/,Senior Registered Migration Agent/Licensed Immigration Adviser,,"Melbourne, Australia",New Zealand Translation Centre,https://www.linkedin.com/company/1235342/,Freelance Translator / Editor,,"Wellington & Wairarapa, New Zealand",Victoria University of Wellington,https://www.linkedin.com/school/15519/?legacySchoolId=15519,B.A.,,"Politics, French, European Studies",1996 – 1998,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Immigration Law, Translation, Visas, Legal Advice, Strategic Planning, Technical Translation, Consulting, Recruiting, Blogging, File Management, Foreign Languages, Interpreting, Editing, Proofreading, Legal Writing, Travel Planning, Training, Time Management, Coaching, Language Teaching, Teaching English as a Second Language, Migration Law, Employment-based Immigration, Skilled Migration, Immigration Issues, Global Immigration, Citizenship, International Migration, Global Mobility, Language Learning, Medical Translation, International Travel, Professional Mentoring, Global Client Management, Template Creation, Compliance, Coaching Staff",Immigration Law,18,Translation,13,Visas,11,Legal Advice,6,Strategic Planning,5,Technical Translation,3,https://www.linkedin.com/in/ankasahin/,ankasahin,2018-10-19T13:29:11.653Z

In 2010 I have established a series of International HR Education Conferences - in Sydney, Durban, Cracow, Taipei and in Washington DC (Nov. 2014).

https://www.linkedin.com/in/jessicapstokes,"Confidence is one thing, but having a strategy, seeking the right advice and coaching can help you secure the career you want. 

Sometimes it is hard to believe in your own worth and apply for a promotion or pay rise. Maybe you qualify for a new role but you feel you are being overlooked by management. You might be worried about returning to work in a full time or part time role after maternity leave and choose not to pursue the career you love.

The national gender pay gap is currently at 18.8% with men coming out on top according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics. The source of the discrepancy is complex, but overcoming mental barriers and building resilience in the workplace can be a vital step for women hoping to take action and maximise their pay potential.

I am a family lawyer and founder of Resilient Queens, a Community for energetic business women to connect, collaborate and empower. I also provide corporate coaching and resilience workshop training to empower female professionals in Perth. Having seven year’s experience working as a dispute resolution lawyer at two international law firms in Perth and serving on the Women Lawyers of Western Australia not for profit organisation and International Women’s Day Perth Committee I am passionate about empowering females to take control of their lives and become who they want to be. I improve staff productivity by working with individuals, corporate clients and business owners to help them identify their unique clear and compelling vision, create a unbeatable strategic plan and enable them to overcome mental barriers that have held them back in the past.

https://www.linkedin.com/in/clairemareeledder,"A CPA qualified Executive Commercial Leader & CFO, I offer over 20 years’ experience driving P&L performance and the achievement of shareholder objectives as a trusted C-level advisor for global, blue-chip organisations. 

Leveraging a Big 4 training and experience overseas before moving into industry, I’ve built a career portfolio that traverses international FX and trade, supply chain, sales and marketing, production, shared services, and, most recently, corporate finance, business restructuring and organisational development. In a similar manner, I’ve gained practical leadership exposure across the full spectrum of executive finance accountabilities, from analysing and driving the granular detail of operational P&L performance to setting long-term strategic direction. 

Working with the FMCG industry for over 18 years’, I understand in practice what ‘fast moving’ means. Years of experience partnering with sales teams has instilled a sense of urgency in me that is palpable to those I work with, and manifests itself in a quick-footed ability to find strategic solutions to business problems. 

Added to this professional agility is commercial adaptability, having successfully transitioned in to an executive commercial business partnering role in the insurance industry with IAG in 2018. 

Key to my success has been an ability to influence business outcomes, not only through securing buy-in to strategic recommendations, but by elevating leadership capabilities across teams to unlock potential and promote accountability for continuous improvement and positive change.

https://www.linkedin.com/in/gennavievelyons,"Despite being quite the traveller and adrenaline junkie, Gennavieve’s main passion has always been property and investing. After graduating high school, she worked three jobs, seven days a week, until buying her first house at 18. By 21, Gennavieve had properties in 3 countries, and the rest is history!

Gennavieve holds several qualifications, including Certificates in Business, Management, Life Coaching and a Bachelor's degree in Journalism, which she put to good use as a News Reader with several Queensland radio stations before moving to Perth.

Despite loving life in radio, at the end of the day it was still a job she was required to attend, day in day out, and (as you will come to learn) the thought of that has never sat right with her – her job was restricting her time and financial ability to give back to the world.

Upon moving to Perth, she made the conscious decision to step away from Journalism. Instead, spending almost every dollar and waking hour gaining a solid financial education and reigniting her love for property.

Now, as an active Australian & International property investor, Gennavieve spends her time traveling, predominantly split between Australia and America, where she ‘flips properties’ for fun, giving her the freedom she was after to help and educate others to live a life on their terms as well.

It is Gennavieve’s thirst for learning and watching others achieve that ‘light bulb’ moment that lead her to this point and the creation of Lyons Property Mentoring. With clients and subscribers coming from all walks of life, with amazing stories, knowledge and experience.

For those who are looking to gain something extra from their lives, Gennavieve is always more than happy to share her journey with you in the hope of bringing some inspiration (or humour, there’s been a lot of mistakes!) to your day, but more importantly to help you progress towards your own ‘Why’.

Providing enlightenment around both property investing and personal mindset; with the mission of giving as many people as possible that ‘light bulb moment’ and show you that a life of abundance IS absolutely possible!

If you, like Gennavieve, know what you want to achieve and are super passionate about the big goals you’ve set for yourself, but can’t seem to find the right people to assist you on your journey, it’s time to EDUCATE YOURSELF!

There is a massive lack of unbiased, well-rounded education available to the everyday Australian, which as a result gives people the impression that investing is difficult or out of reach. There was a need for people to be TAUGHT ABOUT INVESTING, BY AN ACTIVE INVESTOR, that covers not just where and how to buy property, but how to get through life as an investor- how to train your mindset to handle the ups and downs and live a life most people can’t get their head around because they are taught to be a slave to the system.

We’re proud to say that today, we have created just that with Lyons Property Mentoring’s Training Ring! We become partners on your personal journey to ACHIEVING YOUR FINANCIAL AND LIFESTYLE GOALS, with everything you need to know presented in easy to understand, weekly online trainings for you to access at your own convenience.

When you subscribe to this exclusive members’ area, in addition to the weekly training you get FREE access to The Lyons Den, our investor community hangout, where all of our members get to share their stories, ask questions and support, celebrate and motivate each other.

☛ We ensure that your training investment makes an impact on your business objectives
☛ We ensure that all forms of training are applied back in the workplace
☛ We ensure trainees are engaged, motivated, & apply their learning in their job
☛ We ensure new knowledge is built upon & shared so everyone benefits

LearningWise has found many businesses have invested in training, only to have that training disconnected from their business objectives - and left in the bottom drawer.

We help businesses get the full value from training.

Try this quick quiz:

①	Do you/your people disseminate their learning after attending training courses, eLearning, professional development, trade shows, conferences, workshops, seminars?
②	Do you/your people disseminate their learning from informal events such as coaching/ mentoring, webinars, YouTube, networking, meetings?
③	Do you have a systematic or ad hoc approach to workplace learning and development?
④	Do you capture the benefit of these training events as part of the organisation’s knowledge capital?
⑤	Can you prove this training is making an impact on your business?
⑥	Can you see the results of this training in your people’s workplace performance?
⑦	Are your learning programs aligned to your business objectives?
⑧	Do you know your business’s return on its learning/training investment?
⑨	Do you have a plan to identify the workplace learning your company needs to survive the future?
⑩	When someone leaves your workplace, do you capture their skills & knowledge before they leave?

If you answered No to any of these questions, then LearningWise can help you realise all these benefits and achieve the outcomes you want – and need – from training.

https://www.linkedin.com/in/elenikyritsis,"My Educational Philosophy:

Teaching in the 21st Century requires teachers to be flexible and versatile in providing students with a range of tools to support their learning. Today’s classrooms are not just about the learning that occurs within the classroom, but also when teachers flatten the walls and connect students learning to wider communities, giving student learning an authentic purpose and meaning. The learning environment should be built around positive relationships where each child feels safe, valued and respected. Teaching enables me to continue to build upon my knowledge and skills everyday. It creates memories for both my students and myself that last a lifetime.

The 'hope' I'm talking about isn't a spike of personal enthusiasm. It's the most powerful driver of human achievement. 
Hope creates meaning. People who have meaning are engaged. Engaged people take action – in their lives and in their work. And action drives growth, for individuals and for businesses. 
Through a series of ongoing and one-off seminars I work with hundreds, if not thousands, of people in any organisation.This isn't about empty profit promises. It's about creating lasting change by helping people re-discover hope.
