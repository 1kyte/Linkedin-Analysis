Engari, ko te manu e kai ana i te mātauranga, nōna te ao. \n\nI have been working in the field of immigration since 2005 providing high-level legal advice to individuals as well as corporations. In 2008, I became the first immigration professional in the world to hold a license to practice in both Australia and New Zealand. My expertise in Australian and New Zealand migration matters includes but is not limited to temporary and permanent employer sponsored visas, general skilled migration, partner, parent, visitor, resident return and citizenship applications.\n\nDuring my time in the profession, I have assisted thousands of individuals from more than 70 different nationalities and advised some of the most prominent corporate entities in Australia directly on employee eligibility, sponsorship obligations and compliance.\n\nAs a well-known and senior practitioner in this field, I place a great deal of emphasis on productive networking and on using my knowledge and experience to further the standing of the profession as a whole. I am the most prolific contributor to the MIA Forum for Registered Migration Agents since its inception in 2002 and am frequently contacted by fellow agents for advice, guidance and mentoring. I also deliver Continuing Professional Development (CPD) to my peers on various different visas through the MIA.\n\nI have been a member of Migration Institute of Australia (MIA) since 2007 and am currently the President of the Victoria and Tasmania Branch, having been elected in 2015 and then again in 2017 with an increased majority. As Branch President, I serve as a Director on the Board of the MIA.\n\nI take a keen interest in multicultural affairs and matters concerning the profession at large. Between 2010 and 2012, I successfully and single-handedly lobbied the Immigration Advisers Authority (IAA) in New Zealand to adopt a Māori name as well as institute a standard Māori term for 'Licensed Immigration Adviser'.","firstName":"Anka","lastName":"Sahin"},"jobs":[{"companyName":"True Blue Migration","companyUrl":"https://www.linkedin.com/company/7730670/","jobTitle":"Senior Registered

began my career as a cadet journalist with the Herald and Weekly Times. Since those days of which I have very distinct and fond memories, I have been on an amazing journey in print media, television and radio. I am passionate about story telling and very proud to produce and host the multi-award winnning 'A Racetrack Somewhere' series which has aired on QANTAS, Racing.com and Sky Racing and won Best International Series at the EQUUS Film Festival in New York. I have had the privilege of working in PR, Media, Marketing & Communications for various major horse racing clubs around the world including the Hong Kong Jockey Club and Victoria Racing Club. I was also part of a great team that re-branded the Moonee Valley Racing Club and marketed and promoted its signature race - the WS Cox Plate. We achieved record publicity and sponsorship during that time. Hosting and producing a weekly radio programme 'Talking Horses' on RSN Sport 927 is something I love and enjoy. It's a chance to showcase the Thoroughbred racing and breeding industry and its people in a unique magazine style format.

You might be worried about returning to work in a full time or part time role after maternity leave and choose not to pursue the career you love.\n\nThe national gender pay gap is currently at 18.8% with men coming out on top according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics. The source of the discrepancy is complex, but overcoming mental barriers and building resilience in the workplace can be a vital step for women hoping to take action and maximise their pay potential.\n\nI am a family lawyer and founder of Resilient Queens, a Community for energetic business women to connect, collaborate and empower. I also provide corporate coaching and resilience workshop training to empower female professionals in Perth. Having seven year’s experience working as a dispute resolution lawyer at two international law firms in Perth and serving on the Women Lawyers of Western Australia not for profit organisation and International Women’s Day Perth Committee I am passionate about empowering females to take control of their lives and become who they want to be.

After graduating high school, she worked three jobs, seven days a week, until buying her first house at 18. By 21, Gennavieve had properties in 3 countries, and the rest is history!\n\nGennavieve holds several qualifications, including Certificates in Business, Management, Life Coaching and a Bachelor's degree in Journalism, which she put to good use as a News Reader with several Queensland radio stations before moving to Perth.\n\nDespite loving life in radio, at the end of the day it was still a job she was required to attend, day in day out, and (as you will come to learn) the thought of that has never sat right with her – her job was restricting her time and financial ability to give back to the world.\n\nUpon moving to Perth, she made the conscious decision to step away from Journalism. Instead, spending almost every dollar and waking hour gaining a solid financial education and reigniting her love for property.\n\nNow, as an active Australian & International property investor, Gennavieve spends her time traveling, predominantly split between Australia and America, where she ‘flips properties’ for fun, giving her the freedom she was after to help and educate others to live a life on their terms as well.\n\nIt is Gennavieve’s thirst for learning and watching others achieve that ‘light bulb’ moment that lead her to this point and the creation of Lyons Property Mentoring. With clients and subscribers coming from all walks of life, with amazing stories, knowledge and experience.\n\nFor those who are looking to gain something extra from their lives, Gennavieve is always more than happy to share her journey with you in the hope of bringing some inspiration (or humour, there’s been a lot of mistakes!) to your day, but more importantly to help you progress towards your own ‘Why’.

There was a need for people to be TAUGHT ABOUT INVESTING, BY AN ACTIVE INVESTOR, that covers not just where and how to buy property, but how to get through life as an investor- how to train your mindset to handle the ups and downs and live a life most people can’t get their head around because they are taught to be a slave to the system.\n\nWe’re proud to say that today, we have created just that with Lyons Property Mentoring’s Training Ring! We become partners on your personal journey to ACHIEVING YOUR FINANCIAL AND LIFESTYLE GOALS, with everything you need to know presented in easy to understand, weekly online trainings for you to access at your own convenience.\n\nWhen you subscribe to this exclusive members’ area, in addition to the weekly training you get FREE access to The Lyons Den, our investor community hangout, where all of our members get to share their stories, ask questions and support, celebrate and motivate each other. \n\nBecause we are client focused, being a member means you also have the privilege of REQUESTING TOPICS to be covered in the weekly trainings!
