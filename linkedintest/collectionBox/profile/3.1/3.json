Mosley","headline":"Expert in Finance, M&A and Private Equity I Partner at Minter Ellison","company":"MinterEllison","location":"Sydney, Australia","connections":"500+","description":"What originally appealed to me about corporate and acquisition finance was that each business being financed or acquired was different from the last. That still holds true today, where one week I might be involved in the takeover of a childcare or retail group and the next week it might be the financing of a healthcare or IT business. This provides exposure to many interesting industries not to mention a wide range of people. I also like working with other people and this industry demands that you do.\n\nEvery lawyer brings to the table their own style. Mine is collaborative, to focus on the issues that make a difference and to never lose sight of our client's commercial interest. After joining Minters in Melbourne in 1996 I did a 3 year stint with Hogan Lovells in London, rejoining Minters in 2002, partner in 2005.  In that time I've worked on some exciting and complex transactions across a broad range of industries. I was lucky enough to be seconded to Croatia for a few months in 2000 where I assisted putting together a guide on how to do business in that country.\n\nRecent transactions in the M&A space: amaysim's acquisition of Click Energy, FOXTEL's acquisition of Austar, TPG's acquisition of Pipe Networks, Vocus' acquisition of Amcom and Tronox's acquisition of Exxaro.  Private equity transactions: Anchorage Capital Partners of Affinity Education and Quadrant Private Equity of ICON Cancer Care and Fitness Lifestyle Group. Corporate financings: InfoTrack and the share registry business Link Group.\n\nOutside of work I'm kept active with 4 children and interests ranging from bushwalking, soccer and swimming to restaurants, social and wine.\n\n鈻� Leveraged Finance | Acquisition Finance | M&A Finance | Corporate Finance | Private Equity | Mergers & Acquisitions | Capital Call Facilities | Syndicated Loans | Bilateral Loans | Mezzanine Facilities | Mezz Holdco Facilities | Intercreditor Arrangements |\n\n鈻� john.mosley@minterellison.com","firstName":"John","lastName":"Mosley"},"jobs":[{"companyName":"MinterEllison","companyUrl":"https://www.linkedin.com/company/7928/","jobTitle":"Partner","dateRange":"2002 鈥� Present","location":"Sydney","description":"鈻� 'Knows what he's doing, knows the direction and always leads the deals' Chambers Asia Pacific \n\n鈻� 'Very commercial lawyer with a strong support team' International Financial Law Review 1000  \n\n鈻� 'A good dealmaker', 鈥榩roactive and commercially sensible鈥� - Asia Pacific Legal 500 \n\n鈻� 'A really great lawyer to work with, John Mosley is proactive, eager and committed to his work.'

I understand the local property market and the needs of First Home Buyers, those who are looking to refinance their existing loan and Property Investors.\n\nFirst Home Buyers\nIf you don't have the knowledge and understanding of the process of arranging your home loan, don't be concerned. My job is to find the most cost effective home loan option for you. I'll review hundreds of loans from dozens of lenders and will work with you throughout the process from interview, to lodging the application. I'll liaise with the lenders to keep you up to date with how the loan is progressing all the way through to settlement.\nYou may be pleasantly surprised at the cost buying your first home when compared to what you may be paying in rent.\n\nRefinancing\nWhether you need to move, looking to reduce your repayments or fix your loan, or need to renovate your existing property I'd like to sit down with you to asses your home loan needs. Competition in the market is strong at the moment and with the recent reductions in interest I'd be surprised if I could not find you a better home loan deal.\n\nProperty Investors\nThe world post GFC has made investing in the share market volatile and unpredictable. The good news for investors is that the rental property market will remain tight for the foreseeable future. If you'd like to find out how rising rental yields and the relative safety of investing in property could help you feel free to contact me at any time.\n\n\n\n-Home Loans\n-Investment Loans\n-Commercial Loans\n-Construction Loans\n-100% Home Loan\n-Low Doc\n-Car finance \n-Equipment Finance\n-Paid & Unpaid Defaults\n\n\nCONTACT ME TODAY!
