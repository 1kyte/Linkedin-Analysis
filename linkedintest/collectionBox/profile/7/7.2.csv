Wesley has had a long term commitment to evidence based, accountable and accessible services for young people. Wesley has guided Ted Noffs through changes which have impacted on the AOD, youth and related fields as a whole, providing an ever improving benchmark for good practice and accountability.
 
Ted Noffs now work collaboratively across Australia to provide outreach evidence based, specialised care to rural, urban, indigenous and culturally and linguistically diverse youth and their families. Particularly in NSW, ACT and QLD.

Wesley and his wife Amanda have committed Ted Noffs to accreditation processes, external evaluations, and collaborative project development, while providing vital infrastructure to Ted Noffs, and other organisations, through specialised training from our internal training arm at Ted Noffs. 

Wesley decided to establish the Ted Noffs Awards in 1999 to honour outstanding individual and organisational contributions in the AOD field. 

In 2003, the inaugural National Drug and Alcohol Awards were introduced, as a progression from the Ted Noffs Awards, as a collaboration between Ted Noffs, the Alcohol and other Drugs Council of Australia (ADCA), the Australian Drug Foundation (ADF) and the Australian National Council on Drugs (ANCD).

https://www.linkedin.com/in/fotinipratis,"A diligent professional with enormous passion, drive, determination and focus.

Absolutely loves a challenge and dealing with complex situations. This gives me the fuel to inspire people, change processes and turn difficult situations around. My ultimate drive is to challenge businesses and people to do things differently while improving the bottom line in the process. 

My ability to understand businesses from the bottom up enables me to formulate commercial and practical solutions for change, and make long lasting impact. 

My ability to work with employees in understanding their skill set and drivers while empowering and guiding them to achieve efficiencies and personal goals is a unique skill set which I thrive on. My forte is to inspire and mentor staff to enable them to be more accountable, responsible and excited to do their job differently - turning the ordinary into talent!

A hands on entrepreneur who enjoys formulating strong foundations for businesses, focusing on strategy, structure, processes, people, procedures, operations and finance while maintaining continuous improvement and a healthy culture.

I love working with organisations that embrace change and have an open mind to implementing new ideas; an organisation that is respectful, grateful and recognises results.  I am someone who works with my heart and soul, so if you appreciate someone like me, we will work well together!

https://www.linkedin.com/in/beneatwell,"Thanks for stopping by, here's a quick overview of what I’ve been up to...

I’ve recently joined Weploy, an exciting start up in the HR technology space, as Chief Marketing Officer with my primary focus on driving sustainable and profitable growth across the APAC region.

Previously I led the marketing team for the LinkedIn Sales Solutions and Marketing Solutions lines of business. Working hand in hand with sales to deliver on always impressive targets we consistently saw success and I’m forever grateful to have worked alongside some incredible talent.

Before that, I spent the past decade managing successful marketing and sales teams in Europe and Australia, building two new business lines from the ground up in separate companies.

On a more personal note, I love data and don’t understand how anyone can create a strategy without a spreadsheet. I’m a big believer in value based leadership and that belonging is a crucial element to any teams success.

Having started my career in content strategy I still enjoy getting my hands dirty writing whitepapers and ebooks. Worked in both start up environments as well as large complex matrix organisations I’ve really been able to hone my stakeholder management skills (the most important skill for any business leader nowadays). And I’m confident in my ability to drive action and help businesses prioritise on what’s most important at that moment. 

I’m always open to ideas on partnerships and the best marketing talent so if you’re interested in working with me in either capacity please drop me an InMail.",https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/C4D03AQEEqLrY8_RefA/profile-displayphoto-shrink_800_800/0?e=1545264000&v=beta&t=K15QsYiua0TYcu_oVjwRAPhI0huljE6TNl8rxeuU61U,Ben,Eatwell,Ben Eatwell,,Weploy,https://www.linkedin.com/company/12893498/,Chief Marketing Officer,"I lead overall marketplace growth at Weploy.
