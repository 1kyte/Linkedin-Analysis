https://www.linkedin.com/in/ngothai,"I wasted 3 years at university trying to get a qualification in IT... 
After racking up a huge student loan in something I didn’t enjoy, I decided I just wanted to work. 

Without a qualification and any career direction, I fell into doing factory work for 5 years. 
The moment when I realised my strengths and passion -- it was HR.

I was able to change the course of my career and have since been in recruitment for over 11 years; placing people in major corporates which include Telstra, Computershare, Exxon Mobil, Foxtel, Link Group, Department of Human Services, Australian Tax Office, NBN, REA Group and many more.
As a Senior Recruiter, my role has always been to find the top 5% of applicants to put forward for jobs -- which meant rejecting a lot of people…

After reading 500,000+ resumes and interviewing 10,000+ people; I saw so many people make the same mistakes again and again.

It wasn’t because they didn’t have the skills, qualifications or attitude; they just didn’t know how to sell themselves. I'm now dedicated his life to coach people about the recruitment blueprint and the hiring psyche so they can get into that top 5%.

Now as a Job-Success Coach, I focus on 3 key areas:

- Mindset: Framing your mind for success
- Personal Brand: Create an image that is valuable to employers
- Hiring Psyche: Understand exactly what employers and recruiters look for 

A regular public speaker at career events and major universities across Australia; I provide insights to all levels of audiences. 

I'm also a Career Mentor for Monash University and Australian National University in Canberra - coaching final year students for success in their career journey.

Our innovative approach to social impact includes; organisational assessment with an outcome measurement focus; transformation of people, leaders and organisations; collaboration and partnership with governments and agencies; and advocacy and empowerment of the traditionally under-represented and under-employed. 

We are creating a movement of change through the organisations, governments, and institutions individuals interact with on a daily basis, and based on empirical evidence, setting the global benchmark for inclusion. We have thrown away the labels that distinguish the differences between people and only serve to divide us. Rather, our focus is on meeting the specific needs of all people.
 
In a nutshell here are the things we do for our clients:
- Inclusion maturity assessment measured against financial and human capital ROI
- Provide advice on inclusion solutions through our employees from under represented and under employed groups
- Training and certification for D&I professionals or project teams implementing inclusion transformation programs
- Strategic inclusion transformation solutions, planning, and implementation
 
Our goal when working with you is to genuinely make a difference to move you from diversity and awareness to a place of true inclusion. At the same time you are working with a not for profit and supporting us in our mission to drive global social change and create a world where everyone is included.

https://www.linkedin.com/in/matt-cumani-4bb8919,"Trainer Matt Cumani established his top-class racing stable, Cumani Racing, in 2015. Taking his cue from an increasing trend shift to rural training, Matt established this enterprise at one of Australia’s premier training destinations - Ballarat, Victoria, Australia.

Newmarket born and bred, the son of revered English Derby winner, Luca Cumani, and brother to renown racing expert & commentator, Francesca, Matt has racing in his blood. 

Matt combines experience from the US, Europe and Australia and boasts ten years of varied and intensive experience under the tutelage of some of the world’s most celebrated trainers, among them, Todd Pletcher, Paddy Gallagher, Chris Waller, Ed Dunlop, and of course, Luca Cumani.

It is this dynamic range of exposure and learned techniques that grants Matt a unique breadth and comprehensive depth unrivalled in the industry. Matt's approach seamlessly blends the best of old school horsemanship with his own take on globally-informed techniques and up-to-the-minute industry advancements.

Cumani Racing is located just over an hour from the Melbourne CBD and is proximate to an array of country race-tracks. The facilities on offer at this booming training centre/racecourse give Matt the opportunity to employ a broader repertoire of training techniques and exercises that make full use of, for example, the 1400m uphill all-weather gallop. The rural context also means a training environment free of the stresses and disruptions that tend to afflict horses based out of metro stables. By keeping horses in a more natural habitat, Matt safeguards the total wellbeing of the horses thus enabling a more focused and effective training regime.",https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/C5603AQFJHehpLynVtQ/profile-displayphoto-shrink_800_800/0?e=1545264000&v=beta&t=_UVRGRrf8lYEW6QgWODhKrRZF0fuWrOB0qFoop73gfM,Matt,Cumani,Matt Cumani,,Cumani Racing Australia,https://www.linkedin.com/company/18255334/,Racehorse Trainer,,"Victoria, Australia",Chris Waller Racing,https://www.linkedin.com/company/2695424/,Foreman,,"Rosehill, Sydney",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Sports, Horses, Event Management, Public Relations, Sports Marketing, Sponsorship, Sports Management, Advertising, Writing, Equestrian, Racing, Social Networking, Equine",Sports,78,Horses,68,Event Management,39,Public Relations,34,Sports Marketing,32,Sponsorship,29,https://www.linkedin.com/in/matt-cumani-4bb8919/,matt-cumani-4bb8919,2018-10-20T01:39:46.166Z

During the preceding years Bryan continue to train a vast amount of winners and was a constant in the top ten of the Sydney trainers premiership. Bryan decide to establish a satellite stable at the Gold Coast in the year 1998 and while only small in horse numbers, the winners flowed. After two years Bryan made the decision to move the entire stable to the Gold Coast and what a move it has been. In this time Bryan has trained the winners of many of the South East corners feature races and has won the Metropolitan Trainers title as well as the South East district tittle twice and also the Ipswich trainer’s premiership twice. Bryan is also amassing an impressive record at the state’s feature race day, the Magic Millions winning most of the races on the card. While he is yet to win the big won he has been placed on a couple of occasions. Bryan has won three group one races and has won over seventy stakes races and well over 1000 winners and this record holds Bryan in the top echelon of trainers in Queensland with very few other trainers having a record to rival Bryan.

He has been breeding and racing thoroughbreds since 1980. He has owned and raced horses in Australia, New Zealand and Singapore and has been successful at Group level doing so. 

Fairhill Farm is located in a part of the Hunter valley that is closest to Sydney, being only 11/2 hours from there, and also 35 minutes from Newcastle. The farm breeds and agists thoroughbreds. It is ideally suited for its purpose due to its varying terrain, ensuring that growing horses have the balance of exercise and feed to develop good muscle and bone.

Since initially selling thoroughbreds through the auction medium in 2006, the farm has produced 2 Group 1 winners, both establishing themselves over the 2011/12 season. They won their races in Hong Kong and New Zealand.

Glorious Days won his Group 1 over a mile in the Hong Kong Stewards Cup, and Choice Bro won his race over 1400m in New Zealand's most prestigious race for 2 year olds, the Group 1 Sire Produce.
  
The boutique farm produces 15/20 foals per year and sells around 10/15 through auction. Its best price achieved was $700k and last year the farms best was $300k at the Inglis Melbourne Premier.

Sheriff is extremely passionate about identifying commercial opportunities, building on and seizing those opportunities. 

Alexanders - Professional services company

With less than four years experience as an accountant and a limited business network, Sheriff founded the accounting firm 'Alexanders' in 1990. Within four years, the firm grew from one person to thirty accounting staff over five offices. The business model was subsequently expanded to offer the public broader business solutions across a number of specialties including financial planning, commercial property, marketing & media, and IT. Alexanders still operates today.


Perfect Vision Laser Correction -retail refractive surgery

Sheriff was instrumental in pioneering laser eye correction technology in Australia, with his company Perfect Vision Laser Correction becoming an industry leader in less than two years of operation.

Prior to inception, Sheriff thoroughly researched the viability of refractive surgery in Australia. Appreciating the necessity of consolidating knowledge to maximise market dominance, Sheriff continues to conduct research on the industry, domestically and abroad. Consequently, his involvement has conferred on Sheriff the reputation as a strategic industry expert. 

Iskander.com - retail and commercial breeding and racing

Iskander.com was established in 2003 with particular focus on brokering of stallion deals and co-management of stallions with major studs. Sheriff and his team identified the opportunity within the industry and have subsequently worked closely with the industry body to establish initiatives in the promotion and development of the Australian thoroughbred industry.

What does our mission statement mean? 
  
All of us have been touched in some way or another by riding, by owning, or purely by loving the race horse.   This horse has taken us on a journey that will be instilled in our hearts and if anything like us, has becomes our passion.  
We have watched, we have wagered, we have ridden, we have gained so much excitement from the race horse. 
It is the Thoroughbred Club's intention to do as much as we can do to give back - even a snippet – to the mighty thoroughbred and assist in any way we can a safe journey to a new career after racing.
The Club's intention is to offer ""knowledge"" and to take you first-hand, wherever the ex race horse has gone.  We want to see their new achievements.  In some cases, there may not be a new achievement but sponsor a horse and take it from an unfortunately situation to be taken to a new home to rest, re-educate and rehome (which we have done so far for 7 horses and continue to watch their progress).

The Thoroughbred Club will also take you on a year's journey of 5 star experiences at Horse Racing, Show Jumping and Polo with the intention to further expand into Eventing and other ex thoroughbred industries in a timely manner.

Not only will you experience these sports but we will also have various ""get togethers"" where we can talk and collate further ideas and to socialise amongst similar passionate people.

The Melbourne office has played a significant role in attracting an ever-increasing audience to Racenet with the site's news service averaging more than 1 million reads per month.

I adopt a 'keep it simple' approach to everything, including developing relationships with all contacts in the industry, and that approach has enabled me to begin from scratch in 2008 and develop a wide range of relationships.

I also read as much as I can to constantly learn new things.

I have also developed a strong freelance business with a number of regular clients, but welcome all enquiries and contacts.

That freelance work has taken me into the world of radio as a producer of two Sunday programs on RSN as well as an on-air role on RSN's Carnival digital channel. It's certainly an area in which I'm very keen to develop my skills.

+ A lot of people are scared and frightened to mention ""Yah"" God and his only begotten son Jesus Christ the Messiah because the word of God is viewed as not being politically correct or the truth may offend someone what rubbish. Jesus Christ died on the Cross at Calvary for the sins of ""All Men"" and he did rise from the dead and He Lives. Everyone is entitled to there own free choice about the Light and the dark but I implore you to read the Gospel of John in the New Testament for yourself and see if you can hear Truth.

Established in late 2014 Horse Racing Tips Australia has been providing horse racing tips & information covering every Australian thoroughbred race everyday 365 days a year. 

We have as of Monday July 23rd 2018 exactly 280 loyal members and Yes we are a small but very select group of pure horse racing enthusiasts just like yourself and over the past 4 years we have been working hard building trust and trying to carve out a reputation for the quality horse racing information we provide. As a Fact we spend absolutely no money on advertising at all, as all we rely upon is purely the word of mouth from our current members who let others know just how well we have worked for them. And another Fact, Yes it is true that we do not win all of the time as that is just simply impossible, but Yes it is also true that we do win way more often at a far higher percentage win rate than we lose, which you can see for yourself by viewing our daily rating results.

You can visit us today at https://www.freehorseracingtipsaustralia.com

How do we make our selections? Through sheer hard work and learned experience and everything is still done the old original way which means by hand and they are the best selections statistically we can provide and it is a system which we have fine tuned over many years and it works. Remember nothing is absolutely certain in racing, but what is certain is that we are always doing our best to search out those winners for you and consistency is the key to winning at everything in life and its especially important when it comes to winning at horse racing and we feel our rating results will absolutely stand up to this test and you can even view our statistics which breaks down 13,354 races on our horse racing statistics page. And its also very important at this moment to point out the truth and I will tell you a fact, 98% of gamblers lose overall and only 2% win consistently and the reason is they have a plan, i.e. they know all about ""Money Management"", but you can read more about this later in our ratings how-to guide and also by accessing the betting articles section of the website.

Confident, charismatic & versatile, I am always seeking new challenges and working hard to encourage others to achieve their professional & personal goals! 

I have worked at every major sale for Magic Millions for the past ten years, starting as a member of the ground staff, helping co-ordinate the logistics of the sale ring and providing high class care of horses after they have sold. I'm also always happy to help vendors & studs find suitable casual staff to assist with smooth running of every draft.

More recently, I have been given the fabulous opportunity of becoming the first female bid spotter, bringing loads of energy & enthusiasm to my work, ensuring happy vendors & buyers at every sale! 

My favourite bloodstock accomplishment to date is purchasing Encosta De Lago mare, Edel Vanessa, who is the dam of multiple stakes winning mare, Fillydelphia. I have bred full brother to this talented mare who will be racing soon! 

My future career goals include undergoing further training to become an auctioneer, utilising my past experience as a children's entertainer and MC by bringing a fun, exciting atmosphere to any auction. 

I also enjoy helping raise the profile of woman involved within the thoroughbred industry and always encourage other young woman to become a part of this exciting sport!
