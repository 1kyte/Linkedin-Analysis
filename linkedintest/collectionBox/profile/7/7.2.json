improvement and deliver operational excellence. I offer ten years’ experience in the Healthcare sector and ten years in Financial services.\n \nI work collaboratively across organisations to lead transformation and change initiatives that drive productivity and operational improvements to support business growth . I understand that strong, effective teams are the foundation for commercial success, so I am also passionate about fostering a high performance culture where everyone from the production floor and distribution partners through to the senior executive team – are focused on delivering business objectives\n \nWorking at a local, regional and global level, I have established a strong track record for managing change transformation particularly through Supply Chain operations and championing IBP throughout the organisation. I achieve this by implementing well defined strategies that drive innovation and a strong focus on the customer experience thus enabling  alignment and execution of commercial goals. This customer-centric approach is considerably underutilised in supply chain management, and can have a strong impact on profitability – by increasing customer satisfaction, driving sales and enhancing reputation.\n\nThe E2E supply chain is a complex mechanism of many moving parts which provides opportunities to deliver improved costs and service to customers as well as identify and drive new commercial strategies.

I’m a big believer in value based leadership and that belonging is a crucial element to any teams success.\n\nHaving started my career in content strategy I still enjoy getting my hands dirty writing whitepapers and ebooks. Worked in both start up environments as well as large complex matrix organisations I’ve really been able to hone my stakeholder management skills (the most important skill for any business leader nowadays).
