We work with cutting edge technologies and resources, and are supported by the largest and most capable team in naval resourcing in Australia. We believe the most challenging tasks need the most ingenious solutions.

In 2005, ASC was awarded the role of Shipbuilder for the Hobart Class Air Warfare Destroyer (AWD) project. This program sees the most advanced and complex warships ever built in Australia being constructed at ASC's state-of-the-art shipbuilding facility - ASC South - located at Osborne, South Australia.

From 1987, ASC was the prime contractor for the design, manufacture and delivery of the Royal Australian Navy's (RAN) fleet of six Collins Class submarines. At the conclusion of the Collins Class submarine build program in 2003, ASC commenced a 25-year contract with Defence Materiel Organisation (DMO) for the ongoing repair, maintenance and design upgrades of the submarines through life.

https://www.linkedin.com/company/cotton-on-group,https://www.linkedin.com/company/cotton-on-group,Cotton On Group,Apparel & Fashion,"North Geelong, VIC","To ‘cotton on’ to something means to understand or discover the potential of a great idea. In 1991 our first retail store opened in Geelong, Australia. From these humble beginnings, we’ve taken our big ideas and Aussie spirit to the globe. And in 25 short years, we’ve grown to become Australia’s largest fashion value retailer, with 7 brands, 1400+ stores, across 19 countries, all powered by an energetic, optimistic global family in excess of 20,000 people. 

Today the Cotton On Group family has expanded to seven brands including, Cotton On, Cotton On Kids, Cotton On Body, Rubi, Typo, Factorie and Supre.  
 
It all started in the late eighties when acid wash and lycra ruled the fashion world. Nigel Austin, our founder, grew up in Geelong with strong family ties to the rag trade. He spent school holidays learning the ropes with his dad’s manufacturing and importing business – building the confidence and hands-on approach that would still ring true decades later. At age 18, Nigel headed to the local Beckley Market in Geelong, armed with a pile of acid wash denim jackets. It was the start of something big.

People are our passion. We put them first in everything we do; every day. We draw in people we love and who love us, and we focus on creating amazing experiences for everyone we meet. We’re a fun, energetic team; our work inspires us, gets the best out of ourselves and makes a positive difference - ultimately, that’s why we’re here.

In July 2004, JB bought the Queensland Clive Anthony chain of stores which sell consumer electronics, white goods, cooking appliances and air-conditioning.

 On the 29th of April 2014 the Port of Rotterdam and TPK (Terminal Presidente Kennedy) Logistica signed a joint venture agreement in Vitória, Brazil for the development of Porto Central.

It was developed with the support of more than 125 construction CEOs and various association and academic leaders who united to revolutionize training for the construction industry. Sharing the common goal of developing a safe and productive workforce, these companies created a standardized training and credentialing program for the industry. This progressive program has evolved into curricula for more than 70 craft areas and a complete series of more than 70 assessments offered in over 4,000 NCCER-accredited training and assessment locations across the United States.

NCCER develops standardized construction and maintenance curriculum and assessments with portable credentials. These credentials are tracked through NCCER’s Registry System that allows organizations and companies to track the qualifications of their craft professionals and/or check the qualifications of possible new hires. NCCER's Registry System also assists craft professionals by maintaining their records in a secure database.

NCCER’s workforce development process of accreditation, instructor certification, standardized curriculum, registry, assessment and certification is a key component in the industry’s workforce development efforts. NCCER also drives multiple initiatives to enhance career development and recruitment efforts for the industry, primarily through its Build Your Future initiative.

You’ll find them in smartphones, planes, cars, hospitals and throughout your home. 

We operate with pioneering spirit. We’ve developed some of the world’s largest and best quality mines and operations, and our people work in around 35 countries across six continents. We’ve pioneered technological innovations, such as our Mine of the Future™ programme and our low-CO2 aluminium from hydropower. And we’ve paved the way in areas such as safety, tax transparency and legacy management. 

We continue to pioneer progress for a better future. Through research and innovation, we’re helping meet the needs of society in a growing and changing world. 

We produce essential materials responsibly. Our activities help economies grow and communities prosper. And it’s all underpinned by an absolute commitment to safety – for our people, contractors, and the communities in which we operate – and to minimising our environmental impact.  

We partner for human progress. We partner with auto industry leaders in developing alloys that are enabling a new generation of lighter, fuel-efficient vehicles. We partner with peers in organisations like the International Council on Mining & Metals to seek better ways to operate.

The construction of the Snowy Mountains Scheme is a well documented part of our nation’s history and we are a great example of Aussie innovation and ingenuity. From those beginnings, we have become a dynamic and growing end to end energy provider with the complete service offering, backed by the mighty Snowy. We’ve evolved from an electricity generator to an integrated energy business - generating energy, providing price risk management products for wholesale customers and delivering energy to homes and businesses as the fourth largest energy retailer in the National Electricity Market (NEM).

We own, operate and maintain the 4100MW Snowy Scheme, the 300MW Valley Power gas-fired power station, the 320MW Laverton North gas-fired power station and the 667MW gas-fired generator at Colongra in New South Wales – a flexible and reliable mix of energy. 

Every day we provide fast, clean electricity and gas to our almost one million account holders who are households and businesses - big and small - across the country. Red Energy has been part of our business for more than a decade and we added Lumo Energy to our company in 2014.

Everyone has a story that influenced their choice to work at an inspirational and world-changing organisation like SBS. Perhaps it was because SBS was what their parents listened to on the radio when arriving from a new country, as it reminded them of home.  Maybe they’ve seen hardships in foreign countries and it’s changed the way they see the world. It may have been the first channel they watched where the content they viewed was relatable to them and their life in Australia. Or maybe they just want to make Australia a better place and SBS is a network that allows them to do this. Whatever it is, it made enough of an impact on them to want to make a meaningful impact in their job.

Through SBS Radio, SBS Television and SBS Online, we tell the stories of humankind in more languages than any other broadcaster in the world; at last count, 68 languages on radio, more than 60 on television and more than 50 online.   Our free-to-air television offerings include SBS, SBS Viceland and SBS Food Network, pay TV offerings with World Movies and content from right across our network available 24/7 anytime and on any device via SBS On Demand.

In the 21st century, multiculturalism means more than bringing the cultures of other worlds into your home.

STING produces a premium range of fitness equipment designed to withstand the rigours of high-performance training and competition. STING products combine unrivalled quality, supreme comfort and superior style to unleash the ultimate performance in every athlete.

STING was founded in Melbourne by two sports fans who shared a passion for fitness. After noticing a gap in the market for high quality, affordable products, the boys decided to create their own....thus STING was born.

With an initial focus on fight sports, boxing gloves were and still are our signature product. While the basic design of boxing gloves has changed very little over the decades, STING takes the humble boxing glove to the next level by combining traditional manufacturing methods with state-of-the art materials and innovative design. 

From our first range of boxing gloves, STING developed a reputation as a brand whose products consistently delivered the very best feel, fit and performance. 

Our focus on quality sets us apart from our competitors and as we expand our range to encompass a wider range of sports and fitness activities, our desire to continually deliver exceptional products shapes everything we do.

Every item in the STING range has been tried, tested and approved by professional athletes. We use only the finest and most innovative technical materials, and we manufacture to the highest specifications, each and every time.

STING is an official licensee to AIBA (International Boxing Association Amateur) and since has supplied the equipment to the 2014 Glasgow Commonwealth Games, APB (AIBA Professional Boxing), WSB (World Series Boxing) the 2016 Rio Olympic Games and will feature on home soil at the Gold Coast Commonwealth Games in 2018.

https://www.linkedin.com/company/tarocash,https://www.linkedin.com/company/tarocash,TAROCASH,Retail,,"In 1987 two brothers, Stephen and Michael Leibowitz, immigrated to Australia, bringing with them a family heritage of menswear retailing from South Africa. Two weeks later they began supplying wholesale menswear to retail outlets across Australia and quickly realised that Australian men were in desperate need of their own coordinated range of smart-casual clothing. They opened their first store under the name “Café” the following year, and by 1991 had five stores. 

By then, the business needed a new name. Tarocash was derived from the first two letters of each of their children’s names. Today, Tarocash has grown into one of Australia’s most successful menswear retailers, with over 110 stores across Australia and New Zealand and many stockists throughout the region. The original philosophy of providing outstanding service remains, but to its customers Tarocash means quality, value and the latest smart-casual fashion for any occasion.

Every season we search out the latest trends and tailor them to suit the Aussie bloke. We pride ourselves in offering a broader range of sizes than most brands so we’ll always have the perfect fit. And, our service is friendly and honest. There’s no attitude or hard sell in our stores, and you can be sure of great quality and value in every deal.  You know when you look and feel great. Let us help you get there.

Tarocash is part of the Retail Apparel Group (RAG).
