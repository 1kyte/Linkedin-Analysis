In 1991 our first retail store opened in Geelong, Australia. From these humble beginnings, we\u2019ve taken our big ideas and Aussie spirit to the globe. And in 25 short years, we\u2019ve grown to become Australia\u2019s largest fashion value retailer, with 7 brands, 1400+ stores, across 19 countries, all powered by an energetic, optimistic global family in excess of 20,000 people. \n\nToday the Cotton On Group family has expanded to seven brands including, Cotton On, Cotton On Kids, Cotton On Body, Rubi, Typo, Factorie and Supre.  \n \nIt all started in the late eighties when acid wash and lycra ruled the fashion world. Nigel Austin, our founder, grew up in Geelong with strong family ties to the rag trade. He spent school holidays learning the ropes with his dad\u2019s manufacturing and importing business \u2013 building the confidence and hands-on approach that would still ring true decades later. At age 18, Nigel headed to the local Beckley Market in Geelong, armed with a pile of acid wash denim jackets. It was the start of something big.\n\nPeople are our passion. We put them first in everything we do; every day. We draw in people we love and who love us, and we focus on creating amazing experiences for everyone we meet. We\u2019re a fun, energetic team; our work inspires us, gets the best out of ourselves and makes a positive difference - ultimately, that\u2019s why we\u2019re here.\n\nAnd true to Nigel\u2019s solutions-focused mindset from back in the day, we always strive to be better at everything we do, every day \u2013 whether that\u2019s for our customers, our people or the community. Central to this is the lifeblood of our organization; our philanthropic arm, the Cotton On Foundation. \n\nEvery day can be a great day at the Cotton On Group and all great days start with great people. When you become one of our people, you really can start here and go anywhere!\n\nFollow more of the Group's news on Instagram at @cotton_on_group.", "RelatedCompany4EmployeesRange": "5,001-10,000 employees", "RelatedCompany1Sector": "", "RelatedCompany2EmployeesRange": "501-1,000 employees", "link": "https://www.linkedin.com/company/cotton-on-group", "RelatedCompany6LinkedInURL": "https://www.linkedin.com/company/the-iconic/", "RelatedCompany2LinkedInURL": "https://www.linkedin.com/company/sportsgirl/", "name": "Cotton On Group", "industry": "Apparel & Fashion", "RelatedCompany3Name": "MYER", "RelatedCompany2Name": "Sportsgirl", "RelatedCompany3Sector": ""}, {"RelatedCompany4Name": "BRAMBLE ENERGY LIMITED", "RelatedCompany1Name": "OCTAVIAR LIMITED", "employeesOnLinkedIn": 16, "RelatedCompany3EmployeesRange": "10,001+ employees", "RelatedCompany5Sector": "", "RelatedCompany2Sector": "", "query": "https://www.linkedin.com/company/crossecom", "logo": "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7", "RelatedCompany1LinkedInURL": "https://www.linkedin.com/company/octaviar-limited/", "linkedinID": "1262864", "RelatedCompany5Name": "Overseas Chinese Network", "RelatedCompany5LinkedInURL": "https://www.linkedin.com/company/overseas-chinese-network/", "timestamp": "2018-10-23T03:44:12.080Z", "RelatedCompany1EmployeesRange": "11-50 employees", "RelatedCompany4Sector": "", "RelatedCompany6EmployeesRange": "0-1 employees", "RelatedCompany6Name": "STUFFED SAUSAGE SOFTWARE, LLC", "RelatedCompany6Sector": "", "RelatedCompany5EmployeesRange": "2-10 employees", "RelatedCompany4LinkedInURL": "https://www.linkedin.com/company/bramble-energy-limited/", "website": "http://www.crossecom.com/", "RelatedCompany3LinkedInURL": "https://www.linkedin.com/company/magna-infotech/", "RelatedCompany4EmployeesRange": "none", "RelatedCompany1Sector": "", "RelatedCompany2EmployeesRange": "51-200 employees", "link": "https://www.linkedin.com/company/crossecom", "RelatedCompany6LinkedInURL": "https://www.linkedin.com/company/stuffed-sausage-software-llc/", "RelatedCompany2LinkedInURL": "https://www.linkedin.com/company/computer-power-group/", "name": "Crossecom", "industry": "Information Technology and Services", "RelatedCompany3Name": "Magna Infotech - A Quess Company", "RelatedCompany2Name": "Computer Power Group", "RelatedCompany3Sector": ""}, {"RelatedCompany4Name": "Timbuk2", "RelatedCompany1Name": "Crumpler Europe", "RelatedCompany6Name": "Aesop", "employeesOnLinkedIn": 53, "RelatedCompany3EmployeesRange": "51-200 employees", "RelatedCompany5Sector": "", "RelatedCompany2Sector": "", "specialities": "Bags, Luggage, Original Bag Design, and Australian Company", "logo": "https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/C4E0BAQF4o_pkHsgjWg/company-logo_200_200/0?e=1548288000&v=beta&t=u4ECzEqrM0-vW7RuwRALL_9YNIL0EFcjp6Wk_PEaEJs", "RelatedCompany1LinkedInURL": "https://www.linkedin.com/company/crumpler/", "linkedinID": "720364", "RelatedCompany5Name": "ThankyouAUS", "RelatedCompany5LinkedInURL": "https://www.linkedin.com/company/thankyou-group/", "timestamp": "2018-10-23T03:44:14.075Z", "RelatedCompany1EmployeesRange": "51-200 employees", "RelatedCompany4Sector": "", "yearFounded": "1995", "RelatedCompany6EmployeesRange": "1,001-5,000 employees", "query": "https://www.linkedin.com/company/crumpler-australia", "location": "Melbourne, Victoria", "RelatedCompany6Sector": "", "RelatedCompany5EmployeesRange": "51-200 employees", "RelatedCompany4LinkedInURL": "https://www.linkedin.com/company/timbuk2/", "size": "51-200 employees", "website": "http://www.crumpler.com/", "RelatedCompany3LinkedInURL": "https://www.linkedin.com/company/keepcup/", "description": "Built for purpose & made to last: welcome to Crumpler.\n\nBorn in Melbourne, 1995, with a creative spirit that remains today, our community is full of busy people, creative thinkers, and innovators who, pack a lot into their days.

It is still a family owned Australian company now operated by Linda & Neville Kitchen (Bill May\u2019s daughter and son in law). Bill May a musician and woodwork teacher built his first guitar at the age of 17 in 1936 (the guitar hangs in the showroom to this day). Shortly afterwards, Bill established a custom manufacturing and repair business known as \u201cMaton Stringed Instruments & Repairs\u201d. His older brother Reg joined him in March 1946 and the company was born. Today we pride ourselves in the discovery and promotion of Australian tone-woods and have mastered the use of sustainable alternatives to traditional timbers, lighting the way for guitar manufacturers all over the world.

It was developed with the support of more than 125 construction CEOs and various association and academic leaders who united to revolutionize training for the construction industry. Sharing the common goal of developing a safe and productive workforce, these companies created a standardized training and credentialing program for the industry. This progressive program has evolved into curricula for more than 70 craft areas and a complete series of more than 70 assessments offered in over 4,000 NCCER-accredited training and assessment locations across the United States.\n\nNCCER develops standardized construction and maintenance curriculum and assessments with portable credentials. These credentials are tracked through NCCER\u2019s Registry System that allows organizations and companies to track the qualifications of their craft professionals and/or check the qualifications of possible new hires. NCCER's Registry System also assists craft professionals by maintaining their records in a secure database.\n\nNCCER\u2019s workforce development process of accreditation, instructor certification, standardized curriculum, registry, assessment and certification is a key component in the industry\u2019s workforce development efforts. NCCER also drives multiple initiatives to enhance career development and recruitment efforts for the industry, primarily through its Build Your Future initiative.\n\nNCCER\u2019s new branding and international initiatives have led to the use of NCCER in lieu of The National Center for Construction Education and Research.

Two weeks later they began supplying wholesale menswear to retail outlets across Australia and quickly realised that Australian men were in desperate need of their own coordinated range of smart-casual clothing. They opened their first store under the name \u201cCaf\u00e9\u201d the following year, and by 1991 had five stores. \r\n\r\nBy then, the business needed a new name. Tarocash was derived from the first two letters of each of their children\u2019s names. Today, Tarocash has grown into one of Australia\u2019s most successful menswear retailers, with over 110 stores across Australia and New Zealand and many stockists throughout the region. The original philosophy of providing outstanding service remains, but to its customers Tarocash means quality, value and the latest smart-casual fashion for any occasion.\r\n\r\nEvery season we search out the latest trends and tailor them to suit the Aussie bloke. We pride ourselves in offering a broader range of sizes than most brands so we\u2019ll always have the perfect fit. And, our service is friendly and honest.
