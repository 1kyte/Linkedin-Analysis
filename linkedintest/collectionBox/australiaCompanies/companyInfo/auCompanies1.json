Despite John's enthusiasm for appliances, his family did not believe online retail could be successful, and in 2005 at just 21 years of age, John set out with a $50,000 business loan and founded a stand-alone online retail business.\r\n \r\nAppliances Online catered to a growing market of Australians looking for an efficient, streamlined shopping experience that's affordable, convenient and hassle-free. Although the site initially catered to time-poor consumers looking for a replacement item in the Sydney area, the business'​ customer base has evolved to include builders, real estate property managers and renovators from all across Australia.\r\nExpansion has occurred at every level of the business. \r\n\r\nAppliances Online now employs over 250 people and operates nationally via its own trucks and centralised warehouses in NSW, VIC, QLD, SA, WA, NT and satellite warehouses in Heatherbrae and Canberra.\r\n \r\nAppliances Online’s investment in customer service, technology and logistics has allowed for complete end-to-end service. Something which has been recognised and awarded nationally and internationally, when Appliances Online was awarded with Best Customers Service by the World Retail Awards in 2014. Providing exceptional customer service has been the driving force behind the success and rapid growth of the online retailer, which is now arguably one of Australia's most successful online start-ups.",

From these humble beginnings, we’ve taken our big ideas and Aussie spirit to the globe. And in 25 short years, we’ve grown to become Australia’s largest fashion value retailer, with 7 brands, 1400+ stores, across 19 countries, all powered by an energetic, optimistic global family in excess of 20,000 people. \n\nToday the Cotton On Group family has expanded to seven brands including, Cotton On, Cotton On Kids, Cotton On Body, Rubi, Typo, Factorie and Supre.  \n \nIt all started in the late eighties when acid wash and lycra ruled the fashion world. Nigel Austin, our founder, grew up in Geelong with strong family ties to the rag trade. He spent school holidays learning the ropes with his dad’s manufacturing and importing business – building the confidence and hands-on approach that would still ring true decades later. At age 18, Nigel headed to the local Beckley Market in Geelong, armed with a pile of acid wash denim jackets. It was the start of something big.\n\nPeople are our passion. We put them first in everything we do; every day. We draw in people we love and who love us, and we focus on creating amazing experiences for everyone we meet. We’re a fun, energetic team; our work inspires us, gets the best out of ourselves and makes a positive difference - ultimately, that’s why we’re here.\n\nAnd true to Nigel’s solutions-focused mindset from back in the day, we always strive to be better at everything we do, every day – whether that’s for our customers, our people or the community. Central to this is the lifeblood of our organization; our philanthropic arm, the Cotton On Foundation. \n\nEvery day can be a great day at the Cotton On Group and all great days start with great people. When you become one of our people, you really can start here and go anywhere!\n\nFollow more of the Group's news on Instagram at @cotton_on_group.",

He had one simple philosophy: to deliver a specialist range of Hi-Fi and recorded music at Australia's lowest prices.\r\n\r\nThe business was sold in 1983 and by 1999 another nine stores were opened.\r\n\r\nIn July 2000 JB Hi-Fi was purchased by private equity bankers and senior management with the aim of taking the successful model nationally.\r\n\r\nIn October 2003, JB Hi-Fi was floated on the Australian Stock Exchange.\r\n\r\nNow, maintaining Barbuto's original philosophy, JB is one of Australasia's fastest growing and largest retailer of home entertainment.\r\n\r\nIn July 2004, JB bought the Queensland Clive Anthony chain of stores which sell consumer electronics, white goods, cooking appliances and air-conditioning.\r\n\r\nJB stores offer the world's leading brands of Hi-Fi, Speakers, Televisions, DVD's, VCR's, Cameras, Car Sound, Home Theatre, Computers and Portable Audio and continues to stock an exclusive range of specialist Hi-Fi products.\r\n\r\nJB Hi-Fi also offers the largest range of video games, recorded music, DVD music and DVD movies with over 50,000 CDs and most major studio DVD releases, all at cheap prices!

        "description": "Founded in Melbourne in 1946 by Bill May, the name Maton is derived from a combination of “May” and “Tone”. It is still a family owned Australian company now operated by Linda & Neville Kitchen (Bill May’s daughter and son in law). Bill May a musician and woodwork teacher built his first guitar at the age of 17 in 1936 (the guitar hangs in the showroom to this day). Shortly afterwards, Bill established a custom manufacturing and repair business known as “Maton Stringed Instruments & Repairs”. His older brother Reg joined him in March 1946 and the company was born. Today we pride ourselves in the discovery and promotion of Australian tone-woods and have mastered the use of sustainable alternatives to traditional timbers, lighting the way for guitar manufacturers all over the world. We ensure our team of craftsmen are provided with the very best materials & parts to ensure that your guitar reflects quality in build & tone. On stage, in the studio or in the bedroom, you carry with you an instrument far greater than the sum of its parts. A Maton guitar is much more than just timber and strings. It’s an extraordinary heritage of more than 65 years of fine guitar making and the culmination of the passion and collective experience our talented team build into every guitar.",

NCCER's Registry System also assists craft professionals by maintaining their records in a secure database.\n\nNCCER’s workforce development process of accreditation, instructor certification, standardized curriculum, registry, assessment and certification is a key component in the industry’s workforce development efforts. NCCER also drives multiple initiatives to enhance career development and recruitment efforts for the industry, primarily through its Build Your Future initiative.\n\nNCCER’s new branding and international initiatives have led to the use of NCCER in lieu of The National Center for Construction Education and Research.

The construction of the Snowy Mountains Scheme is a well documented part of our nation’s history and we are a great example of Aussie innovation and ingenuity. From those beginnings, we have become a dynamic and growing end to end energy provider with the complete service offering, backed by the mighty Snowy. We’ve evolved from an electricity generator to an integrated energy business - generating energy, providing price risk management products for wholesale customers and delivering energy to homes and businesses as the fourth largest energy retailer in the National Electricity Market (NEM).\r\n\r\nWe own, operate and maintain the 4100MW Snowy Scheme, the 300MW Valley Power gas-fired power station, the 320MW Laverton North gas-fired power station and the 667MW gas-fired generator at Colongra in New South Wales – a flexible and reliable mix of energy. \r\n\r\nEvery day we provide fast, clean electricity and gas to our almost one million account holders who are households and businesses - big and small - across the country. Red Energy has been part of our business for more than a decade and we added Lumo Energy to our company in 2014. Direct Connect Australia, which we also acquired in 2014, provides us with a unique channel to access customers who are moving home and is a valuable third-party sales channel.\r\n\r\nWe operate under a stringent water licence that allows us to capture, store and divert water in order to generate electricity. That water is then released into the River Murray and Murrumbidgee River systems to be used by irrigators and downstream water suppliers.\r\n\r\nWe are owned by the New South Wales Government (58 per cent), the Victorian Government (29 per cent) and the Commonwealth Government (13 per cent) and we operate as a Corporations Law company with an independent Board of Directors.",

Perhaps it was because SBS was what their parents listened to on the radio when arriving from a new country, as it reminded them of home.  Maybe they’ve seen hardships in foreign countries and it’s changed the way they see the world. It may have been the first channel they watched where the content they viewed was relatable to them and their life in Australia. Or maybe they just want to make Australia a better place and SBS is a network that allows them to do this. Whatever it is, it made enough of an impact on them to want to make a meaningful impact in their job.\n\nThrough SBS Radio, SBS Television and SBS Online, we tell the stories of humankind in more languages than any other broadcaster in the world; at last count, 68 languages on radio, more than 60 on television and more than 50 online.   Our free-to-air television offerings include SBS, SBS Viceland and SBS Food Network, pay TV offerings with World Movies and content from right across our network available 24/7 anytime and on any device via SBS On Demand.\n\nIn the 21st century, multiculturalism means more than bringing the cultures of other worlds into your home.  It is reflecting back to Australians the increasingly multicultural spirit of our own community. SBS celebrates diversity and contributes to the social inclusion and cross-cultural understanding of all Australians - linguistically, sociologically and culturally.",

        "description": "In 1987 two brothers, Stephen and Michael Leibowitz, immigrated to Australia, bringing with them a family heritage of menswear retailing from South Africa. Two weeks later they began supplying wholesale menswear to retail outlets across Australia and quickly realised that Australian men were in desperate need of their own coordinated range of smart-casual clothing. They opened their first store under the name “Café” the following year, and by 1991 had five stores. \r\n\r\nBy then, the business needed a new name. Tarocash was derived from the first two letters of each of their children’s names. Today, Tarocash has grown into one of Australia’s most successful menswear retailers, with over 110 stores across Australia and New Zealand and many stockists throughout the region. The original philosophy of providing outstanding service remains, but to its customers Tarocash means quality, value and the latest smart-casual fashion for any occasion.\r\n\r\nEvery season we search out the latest trends and tailor them to suit the Aussie bloke. We pride ourselves in offering a broader range of sizes than most brands so we’ll always have the perfect fit. And, our service is friendly and honest. There’s no attitude or hard sell in our stores, and you can be sure of great quality and value in every deal.  You know when you look and feel great. Let us help you get there.\r\n\r\nTarocash is part of the Retail Apparel Group (RAG).\r\n\r\nwww.tarocash.com.au",

In Australia, Village Cinemas is one of the country's largest exhibitors with a large share of screens across all Australian states.\r\n \r\nSince its inception, Village Cinemas has not only expanded the number of cinemas it operates, it has enriched the cinema-going experience through the creation of 'entertainment destinations' aiming to increase attendances & improve the world of cinema.\r\n \r\nTraditional cinemas are now boosting quality ambience through stadium seating & digital cinema projection which is poised to spread in popularity in the movie industry due to the crisper, cleaner picture & sound quality. As industry leaders in digital projection, Village Cinemas is dedicated to creating more substantial experiences through digital films which do not degrade over time even after being played over extended periods. This creates opportunities in showcasing past and present movies, alternative content such as concerts, documentaries & 3D feature films.\r\n \r\nAnother unique offering from Village Cinemas are premium sites such as Gold Class, Cinema Europa & Vmax.\r\n \r\nVillage Cinemas continues to maintain its focus on innovation & technology development with the release of the Village Mobile Ticketing site which now gives movie goers the ability to buy cinema tickets online & go straight to the cinema rather than having to queue at the ticket box to purchase tickets. Village Cinemas is a major force in cinema exhibition in Australia & overseas, & continues to lead the world in stadium seating, digital projection, 3D blockbuster movies, premium cinema experiences & innovative ticket purchasing.
