The ‘always on’ Platform uses a scorecard system to identify risks and opportunities in as little as fifteen minutes, giving companies and their advisors crucial insights into the business, and enabling them to accelerate deals, automate tasks, unlock value, reduce risk, and make decisions with certainty.
