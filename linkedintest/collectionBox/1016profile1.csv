So I have skills in Marketing, Sales, Technical and Business. 

I launched Trunked Mobile networks for Motorola, Television NZ and went on to Create and build businesses for Telecom NZ in Cellular mobile data and Vodafone in business Cellular 2.5G GPRS.

Following on from this I created and launched a Business Mobile email service with Optus.

After owning and working in my own small business providing IT network design and support, I joined an international Cellular SIM and SIM subscriber management company, G&D, where I did technical product and sales management.

Since joining CSC and now AT&T I have gained new experience delivering wireless network solutions on mine sites in Western Australia and Queensland.

Recently this has included designing LTE 4G network architectures for industrial users including for a mine site in Laos.

Mobile, Cellular and more recently WLAN technologies has been my industry sector. I have diversified my skills and experience to include Radio and IT components as today's user equipment and services combine both.

I have been pleased and excited to travel the globe both for fun and for work.

https://www.linkedin.com/in/paulinestupavski,"One of my all-time favourite quotes is by Aristotle who said - “We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, then, is not an act, but a habit”. This mindset was at the forefront of my mind when I started my client services career working for Dun & Bradstreet. At D&B I was chosen to service their worldwide internal offices. I relished being thrown into the deep end and quickly learnt that I loved the relationship building side of my role. I liked that I was a part of this niche market and I enjoyed the high pressure atmosphere that involved a combination of: complaint resolution, interpreting highly technical information, dealing with high value clients, training colleagues and being part of an ""ideas generation"" team who tested company software prior to implementation.

This experience led me to OnePath where I was introduced to the world of Insurance in a Case Management role as part of the Underwriting team. I liaised with advisers and clients in a high pressure environment and learned the fundamentals of how the end-to-end retail insurance process works. This was a valuable stepping stone to my current role - Business Development Officer. My BDO role is fast paced, dynamic, energetic and client focused – the areas where I thrive and perform at my best. Advisers come to me as a first point of escalation so I demonstrate high level problem solving skills and am able to think creatively outside of the box. My focus is to deliver a superior level of service and develop relationships with a defined panel of advisers and dealer groups.

I'm looking forward to meeting like minded professionals so feel free to connect if you think we have things in common.",https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/C5603AQFFtvtFh0y9Dg/profile-displayphoto-shrink_800_800/0?e=1545264000&v=beta&t=_re9o2niUzuyBB7CpSaZlUIDVEU1lWjkQekPolWy-Rk,Pauline,Stupavski,Pauline Stupavski,,MetLife Australia,https://www.linkedin.com/company/18428302/,Account Manager,,"Melbourne, Australia",MetLife,https://www.linkedin.com/company/2213/,Relationship Management Support Coordinator,,"Melbourne, Australia",Altona Secondary College,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/index/?keywords=Altona%20Secondary%20College,,,,1992 – 1997,Altona Secondary College,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/index/?keywords=Altona%20Secondary%20College,,,"English/Creative writing, Psychology",1992 – 1997,,,,,,,,,,"Insurance, Risk Management, Wealth Management, Financial Services, Financial Risk, Business Development, Investments, Financial Advisory, Finance, Wealth, Financial Planning, Process Improvement, Business Process Improvement, Term Life Insurance, Underwriting, Strategic Financial Planning, Management, Customer Service, Coaching, Superannuation, Income Protection, Relationship Management",Insurance,46,Risk Management,46,Wealth Management,29,Financial Services,15,Financial Risk,9,Business Development,9,https://www.linkedin.com/in/paulinestupavski/,paulinestupavski,2018-10-15T15:20:30.225Z

https://www.linkedin.com/in/aprillightbody,"After leaving High School, I postponed my University Studies for 12 months and decided to take the time to gain some commercial experience. Having possessed book keeping and office exposure, it made sense to work as an Office Administrator. I was fortunate to partner with new management to implement new software and processes to streamline the business, supporting its growth into new markets. 

Turns out I have a knack for solving problems and delivering change management initiatives. I have since utilised this experience in a range of industries including Travel and Tourism, Construction, Retail and Manufacturing, both locally and globally. 

Spending time in the UK enabled me to adapt quickly to  new environments, different cultures and leverage off my organisational efficiency skills to help deliver business improvement projects. This led me to successfully manage an organisations structural changes, develop new processes, acquire top talent and collaborate with staff to build a strong team environment. 

I genuinely enjoy building relationships with stakeholders at all levels, across a range of industries. I thrive in resolving challenges and don’t mind getting my hands dirty.
