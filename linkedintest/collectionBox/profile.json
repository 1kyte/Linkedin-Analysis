Commerce, whereby I attained a 70+ average. Additionally, I also received an award from Deakin University for being the 'Best Graduating Student'​ with an information systems specialisation. My dedication to my studies, as well as other relevant work experience, has encouraged me to pursue a career within the field of superannuation. \n\nIn my current employment at Super Partners, I primarily engage in customer service. I am entrusted with a variety of tasks, such as administrative duties and data entry. Such roles have enabled me to sharpen my communication and organsational skills, which I had developped from an earlier stage of my life. Predating my employment at Super Partners, I also worked within a number of different customer service environments. This includes my employment at Saipon Thai Cafe, as well as Skilled Group. \n\nFurthermore, I have been an active volunteer at Oakleigh Centre for over five continuous years. My dedication to such a group displays my passion for giving back to the community and to those in need. My time at the Oakleigh Centre helped me to develop key multitasking and empathy skills, which I believe are important qualities. By working with disabled individuals, I have once again been able to develop my interaction skills and on a further level, I have been able to develop a greater patience and understanding for those who are in need.

Those experiences have seen me involved either as a lead or foot-soldier in everything from creating and implementing marketing strategies, farming for analytics, driving social media, producing creative content, SEO-rich copy (including proofing and editing), even user acceptance and regression testing. I think you get the idea.\n\nHaving said all that, the two greatest assets I bring to any team or project are my ability to humanise the digital experience which allows people to understand the value in what we’re doing, and my almost unbelievable ability to empathise, connect and engage with nearly anyone (again, please forgive the lack of humility. I’m usually quite shy). I’m sure you’ll agree that this can be a powerful tool in marketing. I recently completed some emotional intelligence testing which articulated that my capacity to understand and bond with others knows no bounds. That, coupled with my near inexhaustible energy and boundlessly creative mind enables me to not only produce and push out first-rate projects, but perhaps more importantly I can draw people into the narrative. Wow – that’s perhaps the most ‘marketing’ thing I’ve ever written. It’s exhaustive being me sometimes. Actually, that’s not true. I again refer to the Mariana Trench depths of vigour I draw upon. \n\nI also enjoy walks on the beach and reading poetry by the fire. As I look back over this, I can see that it actually isn’t as short as I intended it to be.

Named a child prodigy, the instrument saw her develop from the concert hall stage, to performing solo concertos with orchestra, then to national television and concert arenas. A stream of successful solo work has kept Sally busy, along with events and tours with some of rock and pop's biggest acts including Bruce Springsteen, Lionel Richie, Rod Stewart, Michael Buble, Harry Connick Jnr, Westlife, Delta Goodrem, Guy Sebastian, Kate Ceberano and Ronan Keating, to name a few.\n\nWith her innate gift to play and her natural ability to perform, Sally was accepted into the Conservatorium of Music in her hometown of Adelaide at just eight years of age and was competing in national and international competitions and performing university-level concertos as a soloist with all major Australian orchestras from the age of nine.\n\nIn recent years, Sally is a much sought after musician, working in television, performing, recording and leading the string sections on Dancing With The Stars, X Factor Australia, Australia's Got Talent and The Footy Show. She wows the crowds throughout Australia and Asia at private events and in the corporate scene with her exciting solo performances on her electric violin, and is the lead performer in the electric string trio ELEKTRA, best known for entertaining at corporate and sporting events.\n\nRecently, Sally released a classical/pop album called GOLDEN and is currently, excitedly working on her second album, which has more of a soulful house, dance music vibe.\n\nSally has added her sparkle to countless beautiful events, and she was recently personally booked by Beyoncé to perform at Jay Z's private birthday party.

My \"dual\" ability to look at the big picture, whilst still being a genuine pragmatist ensures real innovation. A natural orchestrator, I can recognise areas of collaboration between various clients, groups and partners. Overall I am a change management leader that thrives at the intersection of IT and business.\n\nMy sole purpose is to achieve the best outcomes for my clients. I listen. I observe. I create. I empower. I deliver.  I know how to translate aspiration into action.\n\nMy company, Career Insight, offers a diverse range of products including: resume writing, interview coaching, psychometric testing, outplacement services, professional development and accredited / non accredited training (focused on cross-group relations, behaviours management, remuneration and rewards), and workforce enhancement consulting.\n\nWhy should you contact me? The world today is vastly different. It is high stakes and competition is tough. One needs to stand out through the disruption of accepted \"norms.\" Critically, my work is very much about future-proofing aspirations. This \"disruption\" is what is necessary to ensure achievable goals. \n\nThus, I am that change agent that can serve as a bridge between strategy, process and technology. I work with jobseekers to prepare them for the open market. I work with recruiters to freely refer candidates who meet their criteria and I work with employers to help resolve unique workforce  issues.\n\nThere is a strategic advantage working together. This is because \"aspiration matters\" to me.

It’s about women connecting with other women, in what can be some of the hardest and best times of their lives – pregnancy, birth and raising their little people. \n\nAn avid ‘girl power’ kinda-gal, Sarah Jane Young set out to create a space where women can come together and be the best person they can be. Sarah Jane believes that a mummy’s true confidence starts with her support system and always knowing she is not alone in the journey that is parenthood. She has also always been a big believer in the power of the ‘sisterhood’, and this only deepened after the arrival of her daughter in May 2015. At times feeling confused, overwhelmed and isolated in those early days, Sarah Jane was inspired to bring together other like-minded mummies to share and grow in their experiences. \n\nThe philosophies behind Mummies Who Lunch are simple: no one baby, mother or dynamic is the same and therefore no one routine or method will necessarily work. Mummies Who Lunch is an empowering and judgement-free space, but also one where you can let your hair down. It’s an opportunity for women to share their experiences with their peers, but ultimately have the confidence to then trust in their own instincts and judgement. There is no such thing as a right or wrong way, and no question is a silly one. Mummies Who Lunch is also all about the mummy who wants to look and feel great. \n\nMummies Who Lunch will be running fortnightly social catch-ups, with workshops to follow in the months ahead. All workshops have been specifically designed to make each and every participant feel empowered in their choices as a mother."},{"companyName":"She is, Sarah Jane","companyUrl":"https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/index/?keywords=She%20is%2C%20Sarah%20Jane","jobTitle":"Editor-in-Chief & Blogger","dateRange":"Aug 2013 – Present","location":"Melbourne, Australia","description":"www.sheissarahjane.com.au // @sheis_sarahjane // facebook.com/SISJBLOG\n\nShe is, Sarah Jane (SISJ) is a Melbourne based fashion, beauty & lifestyle blog. \n\nFor all collaboration enquires, please contact Roxy Jacenko at The Ministry of Talent: roxy@theministryoftalent.com."},{"companyName":"Business Chicks","companyUrl":"https://www.linkedin.com/company/2176086/","jobTitle":"Fashion & Beauty Editor - Latte Magazine","dateRange":"Mar 2014 – Jan 2015","location":"Melbourne, Australia","description":"http://www.businesschicks.com.au/about-us/latte\n      \n\n    \n      \n\n    \n      For all Latte Magazine enquiries, please contact info@sheissarahjane.com.au."},{"companyName":"Heading Out Hair & Beauty","companyUrl":"https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/index/?keywords=Heading%20Out%20Hair%20%26%20Beauty","jobTitle":"Marketing Manager","dateRange":"Mar 2013 – Oct 2013","location":"Melbourne, Australia","description":"Management of multiple social media platforms, web & app design and development, online content management, developing marketing and promotion concepts including POS materials, managing and implementing media strategy, including: planning, execution and review.

Technical College","location":"Melbourne, Australia","description":"Janine Allis is founder of Boost Juice Bars, which has more outlets in more countries than any other juice bar in the world. Janine is among Australia’s most respected business women, having been presented through her business numerous domestic and international awards in digital marketing, retail, franchise and business. In 2015, business magazine BRW named her one of fifteen people that changed the way Australia does business in the last 35 years.\n\nHer vision is to “do retailing differently”, delivering a unique customer experience based on the “love life” philosophy. In 2000, the first Boost Juice opened its doors in Adelaide, South Australia.  18 years on Boost Juice has over 500 stores in 14 countries, having turned over more than $2 billion since inception. Boost Juice Bars is now an Australian icon that achieved an incredible 95% brand awareness rating in the first five years of existence.   \nJanine’s view of the customer experience and thinking outside the square has helped to achieve continued growth year on year. Boost Juice leads the way in digital marketing, smashing records with reach and engagement in all social media platforms, Boost is now used as a bench mark for other retailers on how to market using digital.     \nRetail Zoo was created in 2007 to grow young food retail brands using their expertise and solid back end to grow.   In 2007 RZ purchased then four-store Salsa’s Fresh Mex Grill, which has grown to 40 stores Australia wide and acquired CIBO Espresso in December 2012 which continues to grow year on year.\n\nBased in Melbourne, Janine is a mother of four and advocate for a healthy lifestyle – she maintains a five-day-a-week yoga practice and she is a very average surfer and tennis player...but loves both. \n\nJanine is a bestselling author of The Accidental Entrepreneur which was launched in 2016, and she features on Channel TEN’s, Shark Tank as an investor and podcast co host with Margie Hartley on 'Superwomen we ain't'.","firstName":"Janine","lastName":"Allis"},"jobs":[{"companyName":"MICHAEL HILL JEWELLER LIMITED","companyUrl":"https://www.linkedin.com/company/5624183/","jobTitle":"Director","dateRange":"Jul 2016 – Present","location":"Brisbane","description":null},{"companyName":"Retail Zoo","companyUrl":"https://www.linkedin.com/company/1690517/","jobTitle":"Executive Director","dateRange":"2000 – Present","location":null,"description":"Retail Zoo is Australia’s franchise powerhouse.

In time it grew into a part time job and then into my full time focus.\n\nToday I work on two blogs - Problogger.net, Digital-Photography-School.com which are read by around 5 million visitors per month.\n\nAs someone with no background in tech or web development I'm constantly amazed at the journey I've been on since 2002 and have a passion for helping others on that same path. \n\nWhile I've been at this for a while I'm no expert and am certainly not the biggest blogger going around. I'm just one of millions of normal people around the world using tools like blogging and social media to make a living online.\n\nPreviously I co-founded numerous businesses including 'Third Tribe Marketing' and 'b5media blog network'. I've also had the privilege to co-author a paper book 'ProBlogger: Secrets for Blogging Your Way to a Six Figure Income' (Wiley) and founded the ProBlogger Training Event in Australia - attended annually by over 550 Australian bloggers.\n\nI love to speak at conferences and events on the topic of blogging, social media, building a personal brand, entrepreneurship (and more) and am more than open to be approached from media for comment on such topics. Learn more about booking me as a speaker for your next event at http://www.problogger.net/speaking/\n\nIf we're not connected already on LinkedIn feel free to hit the connect button here on my profile and use the email address darren@problogger.net\n\nI look forward to connecting with you!","firstName":"Darren","lastName":"Rowse"},"jobs":[{"companyName":"ProBlogger Training Events","companyUrl":"https://www.linkedin.com/company/2268119/","jobTitle":"Founder and Keynote Speaker","dateRange":"Oct 2010 – Present","location":"Australia","description":"ProBlogger Training Events have been running annually since 2010 in Melbourne and\n      on the Gold Coast in Queensland and have been attended by thousands of Aussie\n      bloggers.\n      \n\n    \n      \n\n    In more recent times we've begun to take them on the road for smaller regional events\n      in Portland Oregon and around Australia in Melbourne, Brisbane, Sydney and Perth.\n      \n\n    \n      \n\n    \n      More details at http://probloggerevents.com/"},{"companyName":"ProBlogger Training Events","companyUrl":"https://www.linkedin.com/company/2268119/","jobTitle":"Owner and Editor","dateRange":"Jan 2002 – Present","location":"Melbourne, Australia","description":"ProBlogger.net is a blog that helps bloggers find income streams for their blogs.\n      \n\n    \n      \n\n    \n      ProBlogger.com is a community site for bloggers."},{"companyName":"Digital Photography School","companyUrl":"https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/index/?keywords=Digital%20Photography%20School","jobTitle":"Owner and Editor","dateRange":"Apr 2006 – Present","location":null,"description":"Digital Photography School is a photographic community for digital camera owners\n      \n      wanting to get more out of their cameras."},{"companyName":"ProBlogger: the Book","companyUrl":"https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/index/?keywords=ProBlogger%3A%20the%20Book","jobTitle":"Co-Author","dateRange":"Apr 2008 – Present","location":null,"description":"Whether you’re just starting out or have been blogging for years, learn from two professional bloggers how to turn your passion for blogging into extra revenue or possibly a rewarding career.\n\nThis is not a get-rich-quick book, but rather a practical guide to creating and marketing a blog with the potential for generating a six-figure income."},{"companyName":"FeelGooder","companyUrl":"https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/index/?keywords=FeelGooder","jobTitle":"Owner","dateRange":"2010 – Nov 2011","location":null,"description":"FeelGooder is a blog about different aspects of life - finance, health, social good,\n      relationships.... all the things that make life richer and help us Feel (and more\n      \n      importantly BE) 'Gooder'"},{"companyName":"Third Tribe Marketing","companyUrl":"https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/index/?keywords=Third%20Tribe%20Marketing","jobTitle":"Co-Founder","dateRange":"Jan 2010 – Oct 2011","location":null,"description":null},{"companyName":"b5media.com","companyUrl":"https://www.linkedin.com/company/21729/","jobTitle":"Co-Founder","dateRange":"Sep 2005 – 2009","location":null,"description":"b5media.com is an emerging new media network with over 350 blogs covering 11\n      \n      verticals."},{"companyName":"LivingRoom Blog Network","companyUrl":"https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/index/?keywords=LivingRoom%20Blog%20Network","jobTitle":"Owner","dateRange":"Nov 2002 – Jan 2007","location":null,"description":"The Livingroom.org.au domain started as a hobby and has emerged into a small\n      network of blogs on a variety of topics.

Product life-cycles are getting shorter, sales cycles are getting longer, there are more competitors entering every market, and buyers are doing most of their research online before they call you. Many sales people are now struggling to even get a meeting with a buyer, let alone sell them something new. \n\nI have spent the past 4 years researching and studying all of this change, and I have written an international best-selling book called - The Future of the Sales Profession. Through my business (SalesTribe) I now help sales people and business leaders to transform in order to create opportunity amid all of this change. \n\nI have worked in the UK, Australia and across Asia Pacific as a representative of some of the world’s most innovative IT, telecommunications, finance and media organisations, and I have an MBA (Exec) (Distinction) from RMIT.

Our products can be used to make almost anything from a simple pallet to an 8-storey building. \n\nAnd the best thing? Every cubic metre we make has removed 631kg of CO2 from the atmosphere. \n\nThis is why timber has a critical role to play in sustainable construction and manufacturing in Australia. It drives us to ​continually invest in our sawmills, upgrading and installing cutting edge technology so that we can efficiently produce the quality our customers expect.\n\nOur focus is on structural timber for wall frames and roof trusses like our termite resistant Timberlink Blue and our outdoor structural Timberlink Green with the latest enhancement of Low Odour for decks and pergolas. We also make super straight Timberlink Arrow Posts, Timberlink Decking, fencing, sleepers, appearance DAR lining boards, mouldings and woodchips. By cutting a range of products from each log we ensure that we can efficiently supply products for many different uses.\n\nOur three regional sawmills, in Tarpeena, Bell Bay and Blenheim, are supported by our national distribution network. This gives our customers flexibility and fast turnarounds supported by an experienced sales and service team. At Timberlink we are committed to our key values of safety first, openness, fairness, resilience, respect, and integrity. \n\nWe think that what we have is unique in our industry. With a secure access to sustainably grown plantation logs and committed long term shareholders, we are big enough to be relevant, yet small enough to know our customers.\n\nOur most important responsibility is returning our employees home safely.

My educational background in nursing, midwifery and public health has provided me with a deep understand of the health care system in Australia. I am enthusiastic about the ongoing development of health care system improvements within Australia, with particular emphasis on public health. During my professional career I have worked in the public hospital system in both Victoria and Tasmania. I have also worked more recently in the community health sector in Victoria. My most recent work experience was working on projects in Mental Health care, the Aged Care sector and as a registered nurse case manager in the hospital admission risk program in the Eastern Region. I also have recently developed an interest in disability and have spent a significant amount of time learning about the significant changes occurring with the introduction and progress of NDIS. My directorship at Link Health And Community combines my professional skills and passion for fairness and equity in health for our community.\n\nI am at the editing stage of my first book. This is so exciting for me. I am also developing a new program entitled Community Healthcare Coaching. It uses the same perspective as an executive coach. I provide a coach to support people through the health and welfare sector during a period in their life that requires a sensitive and supporting ear. As a coach we would not replace clinical programs but support the successful transition across the system as a patient requires.

The album’s lead single ‘Fresh’ is an established No. 1 hit, occupying the top spot on the official Australian Country Airplay Chart for five consecutive weeks, while Melanie herself recently performed for capacity crowds alongside Aussie country-pop powerhouse the McClymonts on the NSW leg of their mammoth Endless Tour 2017.\n\nThat Fresh should arrive glistening with the kind of polish and perfection that is usually reserved for the work of a veteran recording artist is no accident. Growing up on a farm at Mount Russell, NSW listening to Patsy Cline, Dolly Parton and Shania Twain, Melanie picked up a guitar for the first time at the tender age of 11. The rest is history – and the result of years of dedication and hard work. “I wrote my first song when I was 12, which was called ‘Life on the Land’,” Melanie recalls. “It became the anthem for Woolworths’ National Drought Appeal in 2007. It was really special to me, because I grew up on a farm, my dad’s a farmer, and I’m a country kid.”\n\nAt just 12 years of age, Melanie made her solo stage debut in the monumental NSW Schools Spectacular. The ensuing years saw Melanie graduate from the CMAA’s Camerata Programme twice, enter the coveted NSW Talent Development Project, before attending the famed CMAA Academy of Country Music.

Adam’s progeny (1 Timothy 2:6). \n\nWe hope and trust that by GOD’s grace and mercy and according to His will, the sharing about GOD’s Divine Plan of the Ages (Mark 16:15) and His beauties of truth, will aid GOD’s people in their daily examinations of the Holy Scriptures (as did the Bereans in Acts 17:11) and help them “accurately handling the word of truth” (2 Timothy 2:15) as well as build and strengthen faith and hope in Christ.\n \nFAITH “comes by hearing, and hearing by the word of God” (Romans 10:17, NKJV). \n\nThe highest form of JOY possible while in this carnal abode, comes from the HOPE in Christ founded upon the “exceeding great and precious promises of GOD” (2 Peter 1:4, Colossians 1:27).  \n\nWe encourage our fellow Brother and Sisters in Christ to press onward & upward as they fight \"the good fight of the Faith\" (1 Timothy 6:12), wearing the full armour of GOD (Ephesians 6:14-19) to more than overcome the tests of faith through loyal, faithful obedience to GOD’s will until death. \n\n\"For bodily exercise profits little: but GODLINESS is profitable to all things, having promise of the life that now is, and of that which is to come\" (1 Timothy 4:8, AKJV).\n\nHere

a lot more confident in my day-to-day life both professionally and personally. My willingness to communicate with people around me has more than doubled. \n\nIn terms of my professional career my outlook has completely changed and I am far more positive and my income has doubled. All of this has been achieved with ease, and before meeting Matt I would have never even aspired to do such things. Throughout the whole process I’ve felt incredibly supported and the feeling that someone who has had experience and knows you will make it out the other side is so gratifying. The undeniable support makes this process a lot faster. The program is simple to follow, and simple to bring into your life.\n\nMatt is really good at what he does! I wouldn’t have a problem recommending him to anyone and cannot thank him enough.” 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟\n\n\nHarshal Likhite - Aussie Home Loans: \n“I have been in the business for 5 years and my results were good however I did not know that I could do so much more and within a few months of joining the program my attitude shifted, my beliefs were challenged and my results started getting better. My sales are improving every month and I am doing things which I never dreamed of doing in the past because I used to think that it’s impossible for me. I am now fully convinced that I can achieve bigger and better goals and that I will continue to study this material for the rest of my life.
