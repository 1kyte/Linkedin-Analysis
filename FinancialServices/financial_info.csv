If you’re ready to be challenged to achieve your full potential, we are the place to make it happen. Here, you’ll have the freedom to put ideas into action, own the results, collaborate on a global scale – and make a genuine difference to people’s lives.

Since then, 1,484 new services have been introduced, more than 800 additional employees have been welcomed and 38 new trains are servicing the network.

Currently running more than 15,000 services a week and transporting over 400,000 customers each day over 15 lines, Metro is committed to creating one of the best engineered railways in the world.

Melbourne is Australia’s fastest growing city – a city which is becoming increasingly reliant on public transport networks. Since 2009, Metro’s momentum to grow and change the network has remained steadfast, understanding it is no longer a traditional suburban railway. 

Over the next decade, Metro expects the metropolitan rail patronage to increase from the present 232 million journeys per year to 370 million journeys.

Adopting global best-practice across all facets of the business provides the foundation for the transformation to a high capacity and high frequency metro-style railway designed for the growing city of Melbourne.

With more than 4,000 team members across Victoria, we provide an environment that is rooted in honesty and integrity.

We have a network of offices in Australia and Asia, located in Sydney, Melbourne, Perth, Brisbane, Adelaide, Canberra, Singapore and Hong Kong.

With 200 staff, more than 4500 contractors in the field and 600 permanent placements each year, Peoplebank is the market leading IT & digital recruitment company. 

Our business is aligned to several specialisation areas outside general IT, these are:

-	Digital / Digital Transformation
-	Business Intelligence / Data Analytics
-	SAP / ERP / CRM
-	Security / Cybersecurity
-	Executive IT
-	Transformation / Change Management  

The specialisation areas have been largely driven by the emergence of digital transformation. As digital continues to shrink the globe and improve online experiences, data is more accessible to a wider audience and easier to capture. Ensuring that data reaches only those originally intended is the responsibility of security/cyber security. Capturing the data is one thing; making use of it sprouted the business intelligence arena and the new IT rock stars — data scientists. 

We can offer a range of opportunities across all these specialisation areas, working with the market’s largest corporations through to SMEs and digital agencies.

The Wurundjeri-willam people of the Kulin Nation are the Traditional Owners of the land that is now known as the City of Yarra and Council recognises them as the custodians of the cultural heritage of this land

The administration of Council is spread across three historic town halls, including Richmond Town Hall in Bridge Road, Fitzroy Town Hall in Napier Street and Collingwood Town Hall in Hoddle Street. Council also provides customer service from the Connie Benn Centre at 160 Brunswick Street, Fitzroy.
