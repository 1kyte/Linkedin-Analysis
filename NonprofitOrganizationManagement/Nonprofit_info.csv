The U.S. military defends the homeland, deters adversaries, and builds security around the world by projecting U.S. influence and working with allies and partners. In case deterrence fails, the U.S. military is prepared to fight and win decisively against any adversary.  

Headed by Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis, the Department is not only in charge of the military, it also employs a topnotch civilian workforce. With more than 1.3 million men and women on active duty, and 742,000 civilian personnel, we are also the nation's largest employer. 

The Pentagon, headquarters of the Department of Defense, is one of the largest office buildings in the world. Built in 1941 by the U.S. Army, the Pentagon has 17.5 miles of corridors yet it takes only seven minutes to walk between any two points in the building. 

Department of Defense personnel are the backbone of America’s national security. They represent the diverse makeup of our nation and support not only those on active duty but also families, veterans, and retirees through education, training, and benefit programs. 

Anything you want to do – on land, sea, air, or space -- you can do in service to your nation by joining the Department of Defense. Search for Jobs and Internships at USAJobs.gov.

Everyone has a story that influenced their choice to work at an inspirational and world-changing organisation like SBS. Perhaps it was because SBS was what their parents listened to on the radio when arriving from a new country, as it reminded them of home.  Maybe they’ve seen hardships in foreign countries and it’s changed the way they see the world. It may have been the first channel they watched where the content they viewed was relatable to them and their life in Australia. Or maybe they just want to make Australia a better place and SBS is a network that allows them to do this. Whatever it is, it made enough of an impact on them to want to make a meaningful impact in their job.

Through SBS Radio, SBS Television and SBS Online, we tell the stories of humankind in more languages than any other broadcaster in the world; at last count, 68 languages on radio, more than 60 on television and more than 50 online.   Our free-to-air television offerings include SBS, SBS Viceland and SBS Food Network, pay TV offerings with World Movies and content from right across our network available 24/7 anytime and on any device via SBS On Demand.

In the 21st century, multiculturalism means more than bringing the cultures of other worlds into your home.

PickStar is the best place to book athletes past and present for marketing campaigns, guest speaking gigs, corporate events, brand ambassador roles, skills clinics … or anything else you can imagine.

PickStar gives you have access to over 1000 sports stars across all codes, including cricket, AFL, rugby, soccer, hockey, olympics and more. PickStar works FAST with ANY budget, and it’s free to post an opportunity.

Big brands such as CGU, McDonalds, Uber and Westpac use PickStar, as do hundreds of businesses, charities, sports clubs and schools big and small, with budgets ranging from $200 to $100,000+.

IT WASN’T ALWAYS SO SIMPLE. When James Begley was playing AFL, he wasn’t among the top few athletes commanding big money sponsorship deals. Like most of his teammates, James was on the lookout for more paid opportunities, and the chance to engage with the community.

Following his sporting career, James joined the corporate world and found there was a huge demand to engage sports stars, but few people knew how.

The booking process was a headache for all!

Seeing the problem from both sides, James began planning a centralised marketplace that would help people connect with sports stars, and handle the process from start to finish.

He took the idea to Matthew Pavlich, an AFL legend and former President of the AFL Players Association, and the duo set about developing the website, signing up athletes and building the business.

PickStar is now entering a new era of growth, with a new state-of-the-art booking management platform and international expansion.

Today, each of our communities remains true to our family’s vision – from the staff we choose, to the way we design our residences, to the laughter and joy we share with our residents and their families. 

Proudly 100% Australian and family-owned, we operate 15 aged care residences across Melbourne, Southeast Queensland, and New South Wales, plus two Queensland retirement communities.

We understand the demanding challenges family members face when an elderly loved one can no longer live independently. 

That’s why we offer a respite care program that gives elderly people the opportunity to try a short stay in a safe and caring environment, as part of a gentle, phased entry into permanent aged care. 

People are at the heart of everything we do, from the residents and families we care for, to our remarkably warm and dedicated care team, who work alongside highly qualified and experienced specialists to deliver consistently high standards of care, right across the Group.

Following recent growth, McKenzie now has aged care communities across three states, supporting more than 1400 residents with 1700 beds and more than 1900 staff.

ACSO was founded in 1983 by a man named Stan McCormack, who served a number of years in Pentridge Prison for armed robbery. While Stan was in prison, he underwent a spiritual conversion. There were always people in his cell wanting to talk, or needing advice. When he was released, he created the Epistle Centre; later The Victorian Offender Support Agency for ex-prisoners who were highly disadvantaged. Our founders established support programs and a halfway house (McCormack House) which still remains in operation today. 

ACSO has expanded over 32 years to deliver services across the eastern seaboard for the intellectually disabled, peopling with mental illness, alcohol and other drug problems, offenders and people with long term unemployment. With a staff of over 350 and an annual turnover of approximately $40m in 2016, ACSO is now a leading Australian NFP, delivering more than 20 life changing programs to approximately 20,000 people a year

""It was the sheer determination and drive of founder Stan and his supporters that got ACSO through, even when the foundations seemed to disappear. He was willing, and things happening so fast.

Other free services include supportive options counseling, individual and group counseling for residents and non-residents, advocacy, court advocacy and accompaniment related to Protection From Abuse Orders, community outreach and education, life skills and parenting training, medical and mental health advocacy and trainings for professionals.

The Court exercises powers across a number of jurisdictions including civil, criminal, family law and intervention orders. The Court is the first level of the Victorian Court system.

The Court delivers high quality registry services and has a number of specialist divisions including the Assessment and Referral Court List, the Drug Court, the Koori Court, the Neighbourhood Justice Centre and a Sexual Offences List. These programs are designed to assist accused with issues like substance abuse and mental illness and provide support for magistrates dealing with such persons.
