of land, bricks and mortar. I was also drawn to the capacity of parties in real estate transactions to work together to achieve mutually beneficial and valuable outcomes.\n\nMy main focus for the last four decades has been commercial and industrial leasing. I work with major corporations and listed property trusts in relation to commercial and industrial buildings as well as shopping centres. The natural adjunct has been the acquisition, development and disposal of the buildings in which the leasing business is or is to be carried out. After all, what is being bought or sold is an actual or potential income stream and any due diligence must be primarily concerned with anything which may impact on that income stream. This means that a review of all the existing leases and ancillary documents is critical.\n\nPrudent landlords will require well drafted leases which protect their interests and thereby enhance the capital value of their buildings. Over the years, I have seen innumerable leases and ancillary documents. As such, my clients trust that I know what to look for and that I fully understand the significance of particular terms. They trust that I appreciate that each client and property has its own particularities.\n\nIn a slow-growing economy, costs savings take on a particular importance, especially for building owners. On the other hand, tenants are a landlord’s life blood and their requirements need to be managed accordingly. I am pleased to see there now appears to be a trend in streamlining processes to include more balanced leasing documentation, which should lead to costs reductions for both landlords and tenants.","firstName":"Bill","lastName":"Burrough"},"jobs":[{"companyName":"Self - employed","companyUrl":"https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/index/?keywords=Self%20-%20employed","jobTitle":"Grandfather, farmer and pursuer pursuer of hitherto neglected pursuits","dateRange":"Mar 2018 – Present","location":"Far South Coast of New South Wales","description":"After 40 years of legal practice in England and Australia, I am retiring on 2 April 2018. \n      My last day in the office will in fact be Thursday 22 March as I have a wedding in Japan\n      to attend.

Art Business (Sotheby's Institute of Art, London).\n\nIn 2013 I completed a statistical analysis internship at the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation in Rome. In 2014 I worked in the curatorial team at the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam, where I was tasked with research, valuations, and assisting in curating. From 2014-2016 I wrote for the UK's leading antiques website, and in late 2015 I finished my Graduate Diploma of Education at the University of Tasmania to enhance my teaching skills, professional skills and development  (public speaking, presentation and ethics). \n\nIn 2014 I founded Lugten-Taylor Art Advisory, aimed at offering professional and unbiased advice to art buyers in Tasmania, mainland Australia, and internationally. I am currently Tasmania's only member of the Art Consulting Association of Australia (ACAA).\n\nIn 2015 I commenced work creating a new interdisciplinary breadth unit at UTas which covers a diverse range of disciplines including art, culture, history, business and law. The unit received some of the best unit feedback, 200 students as well as praise for the unit concept, marketing, and new online teaching style. I was also nominated for a Teaching Excellence Award after the first semester offering, and I am currently unit-coordinator and will continue running the unit in semester 1 and 2, 2017. \n\nIn 2016, I became an approved Art Valuer under the Australian Government's Cultural Gifts Program with the specialist areas of 1870-1900 European Painting and 1900-1950 Australian and European Painting. In 2016 I also worked in administration with International Admissions and Recruitment at UTas whilst finishing my Masters with UniMelb.

I have led all aspects of this unit's development, including the creation of the unit's concept/idea, the application/proposals, the learning designs, the lecture recordings etc. The unit soon became one of the most popular units with nearly 200 students in the first semester in 2016, and over 400 students in 2017, as well as high levels of engagement and participation, and great student feedback regarding the learning experience.\nThrough my work in Admissions (Student Operations) at the University, I have developed a strong understanding and interest in the global market for education, and University admissions processes.
