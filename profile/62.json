With this knowledge, I am in a fantastic position to assist clients with their collection queries and advise on the likelihood of a successful resolution."

I also have a keen interest in representing Applicants and Respondents in Restraining Orders matters.\n\nI have a strong desire to help people and I place great emphasis on the relationships I develop with clients  to ensure the transition through their legal matter is as seamless as can be, whilst keeping them informed as to their options to ensure that they achieve the best possible outcome in the circumstances.\n\nIn July 2017, I completed a Masters Degree in Applied Law (Family Law) through the College of Law. About to commence a course with the Australian Tax Institute, I am am constantly seeking to deepen my understanding of the law and its constant evolving interpretation so as to provide the community with the utmost quality service.\n\nOutside of the profession, I  enjoy sports (especially Basketball) and healthy living.",
