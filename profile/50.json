Michael also represents Receivers, Administrators and Liquidators advising on all aspects of external administrations and the associated litigation and is widely regarded as a genuine specialist in that space. \n\nPrior to founding William James, Michael was one of the partners in the Banking, Insolvency and Disputes team at an international law firm. Under Brendan and Michael’s leadership, William James has quickly established itself as a serious player having been selected as a finalist at the 2018 Australian Law Awards for Dispute Resolution Team of the Year and the firm is listed as a recommended law firm for insolvency and restructuring in the Doyles Guide. \n \nOur lawyers and our work are of the highest quality. Importantly, we don't try to do everything. We only operate in those areas where we can deliver market leading performance - restructuring, corporate insolvency and commercial litigation. \n\nWe are also fierce in our independence. We choose our engagements carefully to ensure we can always act without fear or favour.","firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Forrest"},"jobs":[{"companyName":"William
