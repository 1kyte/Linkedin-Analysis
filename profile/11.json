While several clinical and economic benefits are expected by the EHR, it may also lead to information overload, as the relevant information item that an EHR user searches for may be hidden in vast amounts of information within the lifelong EHR. \n\nTherefore, we see an urgent need for supporting EHR users in selectively retrieving information that is relevant in their respective search context. Besides document meta-data, archetype-based dual-model EHR architectures propose a corresponding support, but it is unclear whether they fulfill this promise. Overall, it is unclear what the information needs of health care professionals are, and how to support them adequately by dual-model EHR architectures."

I'm a degree qualified (QUT) ex IT consultant turned recruiter so please feel free to talk technically with me! We have a comprehensive network of candidates and clients alike and also manage many IT contractors Australia wide. \n\nWe do things a bit differently here and try to bring you the genuinely interesting projects in the market. By that we mean working with things like lasers, VR, security, weapons, drones, share trading software, GPS/GPRS tracking, LIDAR, point cloud software, and heaps of rich B2C oriented apps. We also help people like you become recognised in the industry and maximise your actual worth.\n\nFrom a Hiring Manager's perspective, finding and attracting technical candidates can be a challenge and they are seldom found through Seek advertisements. Speak to us on how we can help you confidentially approach and engage the people you need.  Ask me how the market is looking, what skills are in high demand, what candidates are looking for and how your company is perceived in the current market.\n\nEdison Talent also offers full payrolling services, which can save your company time and money. We also specialise in contracting/temporary employment and consulting. \n\n[QLD Government ICT Provider under SOA Number PTD0033-15] (Contract / Permanent / Payroll)\n\n0411404469  tom@edisontalent.com.au.\nwww.edisontalent.com.au",
