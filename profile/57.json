All parts of the Group were used to deliver students a unique learning environment with flexibility and hands on experience.

This was done through a series of meetings, away weekends and regional forums with key party members and key members of the parliamentary wing. Early-on, systems and processes were established to build a team culture but also to enhance campaign discipline and limit resource wasting, including staff time.\n\nThis plan then needed to be actioned and grounded in reality, given our expenditure cap of \n$7.12 million combined with the desire to adequately service a large number of key electorates. This challenge meant tailored victory plans were developed for each electorate in close consultation with the candidate/member whilst being consistent and true to the broader plan.\n\nSignificant internal matters needed to be resolved. Disappointment from earlier events and lethargy had to be overcome. In part, some lethargy dissolved over time, but communication discipline had to be tailored to specific audiences in different ways to ensure a single common purpose. This meant the development and targeting of smart, useful messages and events. \n\nThe campaign result saw the LNP win seventy eight of the eighty nine seats with a primary vote of 49.66% reducing Labor to seven members.
