As Minister for Multicultural and Ethnic Affairs and Minister Assisting the Justice Minister, Michael was the then youngest ever Cabinet Minister in Australia. Prior to this, Michael served as Chairman of the NSW Government Environment Committee, and the powerful Public Accounts Committee.\n\nIn opposition, Michael served in the senior Cabinet portfolio. As Shadow Minister for Transport, he played a key role in advising and scrutinising rail reform across NSW, and keenly promoted the role of PPPs in service delivery. As one of the first advocates of an integrated transport management system in NSW, Michael was instrumental in ensuring its inclusion into the Coalition’s policy platform and current reform agenda.\n\nAs Shadow Minister for Tourism, Michael was arguably the most vocal partner for the NSW tourism industry. Amongst other achievements, he was mastermind of the successful sleep-out in Parliament, protesting against a proposed NSW bed tax.\n\nAfter retiring from Parliament in 1999, Michael established the government advisory firm MP Consulting. In this capacity, he worked for more than a decade with a range of major private sector corporations and public sector agencies. A regular presenter on ABC TV’s “Newsmakers”, Michael continues to contribute to the national conversation surrounding public policy settings and issues.\n\nA former NSW Liberal Party Vice President, Michael has served on the State Executive alongside State and Federal Leaders. Michael also serves on the Board of the Liberal Forum, contributing to NSW policy development and was recently a key member of Barry O’Farrell’s Agenda 2011 Committee, where he assisted on the development of campaign strategy for winning Government.","firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Photios"},"jobs":[{"companyName":"PremierState","companyUrl":"https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/index/?keywords=PremierState","jobTitle":"Chairman","dateRange":"Apr 2011 – Present","location":"Sydney, Australia","description":"Corporate & Business Advisory\n      \n\n    Government Relations & Public Policy\n      \n\n    Strategic & Corporate Communications\n      \n\n    Stakeholder & Public Campaigns\n      \n\n    \n      Public Affairs"},{"companyName":"Parliament of NSW","companyUrl":"https://www.linkedin.com/company/371587/","jobTitle":"Member for Ermington","dateRange":"May 1991 – Mar 1999","location":"Sydney, Australia","description":null},{"companyName":"Parliament of NSW","companyUrl":"https://www.linkedin.com/company/371587/","jobTitle":"Member of the NSW Legislative Assembly","dateRange":"Mar 1988 – Mar 1999","location":"Sydney, Australia","description":null},{"companyName":"Parliament of NSW","companyUrl":"https://www.linkedin.com/company/371587/","jobTitle":"Shadow Minister for Transport and Shadow Minister for Tourism","dateRange":"1995 – 1999","location":"Sydney, Australia","description":null},{"companyName":"Parliament of NSW","companyUrl":"https://www.linkedin.com/company/371587/","jobTitle":"Minister for Multicultural and Ethnic Affairs and Minister Assisting the Minister for Justice","dateRange":"May 1993 – Apr 1995","location":"Sydney, Australia","description":null},{"companyName":"Parliament of NSW","companyUrl":"https://www.linkedin.com/company/371587/","jobTitle":"Parliamentary Secretary for the Environment","dateRange":"Jun 1992 – May 1993","location":"Sydney, Australia","description":null},{"companyName":"Parliament of NSW","companyUrl":"https://www.linkedin.com/company/371587/","jobTitle":"Member for Ryde","dateRange":"Mar 1988 – May 1991","location":"Sydney, Australia","description":null}],"schools":[{"schoolUrl":"https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/index/?keywords=Kings%20School","schoolName":"Kings School"}],"details":{"linkedinProfile":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/michaelphotios","websites":"michaelphotios.com.au/","twitter":"michaelphotios"},"skills":[],"allSkills":""},{"general":{"imgUrl":"https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/C4E03AQFxZuEKgUCEiA/profile-displayphoto-shrink_800_800/0?e=1545264000&v=beta&t=hixi1tGc-iHfuUyd36MQMyf3MOTOW3JSqXUYlAeqZ8o","fullName":"Catrina Yu","headline":"Lawyer at Macquarie Group","company":"Macquarie Group","school":"University of Sydney","location":"Sydney, Australia","connections":"414","description":"","firstName":"Catrina","lastName":"Yu"},"jobs":[{"companyName":"Macquarie Group","companyUrl":"https://www.linkedin.com/company/3537/","jobTitle":"Lawyer","dateRange":"Apr 2017 – Present","location":"Sydney, Australia","description":null},{"companyName":"Gilbert + Tobin","companyUrl":"https://www.linkedin.com/company/163992/","jobTitle":"Lawyer","dateRange":"Feb 2015 – Apr 2017","location":"Sydney, Australia","description":"Private Equity; Mergers & Acquisitions; Restructuring\n      \n\n    \n      Banking and finance"},{"companyName":"Gilbert + Tobin","companyUrl":"https://www.linkedin.com/company/163992/","jobTitle":"Paralegal","dateRange":"Feb 2014 – Jan 2015","location":"Sydney, Australia","description":"Experience in the following practice areas:\n\n1.

The lesson was so indelibly burnt into me that a large part of my time during the 20 years of my practice as a lawyer was occupied in bringing about the private compromises of hundreds of cases. I lost nothing thereby - not even money; certainly not my soul.\" \nAbraham Lincoln\n\"Discourage litigation. Persuade your neighbours to compromise whenever you can. Point out to them how the nominal winner is often the real loser - in faces, expenses and waste of time. As a peacemaker, the lawyer has a superior opportunity of being a good man.\" \nI have been working as a lawyer since 1975, initially in Scotland and since 1984 in NSW.\nWhen I started working in Newcastle, I was employed as a litigation lawyer.  I very quickly realised how disastrous the court outcomes could be for the parties, particularly where there was a relationship that needed to be preserved, eg between parents or between parents and child, or between siblings in a contested estate matter.  \nWhat I went looking for was an approach that would optimise the well-being of the people involved in each legal matter and acknowledge the importance of concerns beyond simply strict legal rights. \nThe underlying idea behind mediation and collaboration is that it generally offers a more resolution-based approach, which can heal rifts and which is healthier for clients, healthier for lawyers and ultimately healthier for society.\n\nSpecialties: Accredited Specialist Lawyer\nNationally Accredited Mediator\nAccredited Family Dispute Resolution Practitioner","firstName":"Anne","lastName":"Kinnear"},"jobs":[{"companyName":"Carroll & O'Dea Lawyers","companyUrl":"https://www.linkedin.com/company/414129/","jobTitle":"Special Counsel","dateRange":"Apr 2017 – Present","location":"Newcastle, Australia","description":"Family Dispute Resolution Practitioner and Mediator.

Alongside our agridigital platform we are developing a blockchain solution for the agri supply chain that addresses 3 key problems: (1) that farmers do not get paid for what they deliver when they deliver exposing them to unacceptable counter-party risk, (2) buyers cannot get the supply chain financing they need to pay sellers on delivery and (3) consumers don't know where their food really comes from. We are committed to solving these problems and de-risking the agri-supply chain for all participants."},{"companyName":"Emma M Weston Pty Ltd","companyUrl":"https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/index/?keywords=Emma%20M%20Weston%20Pty%20Ltd","jobTitle":"Executive & Organisational Coach","dateRange":"Jan 2015 – Present","location":"Sydney, Australia","description":"Emma M Weston provides executive, organisational and personal coaching to CEOs/founders, senior executives and boards.

How nice of you to pop by my little profile, how do you do?\nAnd while I'm in question asking mode...how do you do work? How do you do life? How to you create, compose and connect?\n\nI believe the future belongs to the creators to those who ask questions and take nothing for granted. The past favoured science, logic and reason but the future is geared to the creators - those who wield great creativity, emotion and intuition. Those who tune in, switch on and tap into their humanity, who know what it means to truly be alive. \n\nIn my spare time when I'm not wandering a sunburnt country in my tiny house The Joy Box, I help executives and business owners who are frustrated with the people stuff, to transform their workplace culture into one where their people feel creative, useful and productive. \n\nWe all want meaningful work that allows us to use our UNIQUE STRENGTHS and talents, to create our own path and future every day. Which is why leadership matters more than ever. Leaders are responsible for setting the direction and the environment within an organisation. To grow a great company, a leader must begin by recognising the importance and human power of their people. \n\nI've seen first-hand the strong link between poor leadership, toxic cultures and the absence of employee engagement. I’ve seen what doesn't work and I've worked with those who get it right. Work can and should be fun and healthy.\n\nIf you're a leader ask yourself:\nHow do I give feedback and hold one-on-ones that are significant? \nHow do I get beyond the words and show up day-to-day as a coach not a micromanager? \nHow do we create the space needed for personal growth while raising, our culture standards?\nHow alive do I feel? \nHow alive do my people feel?\n\nIf you want to transform your team or company, attract brilliant talent and create future growth through your human power, then let's connect.

My clients brief me because of our professional relationship, how we work as a team, the effectiveness with which we conduct matters together and how I perform in Court.\nI coach other barristers in advocacy.  Since 2012 I have taught at the Australian Bar Association's advanced trial advocacy intensive each January, for experienced barristers.  I have also taught at equivalent courses in South Africa and Singapore.  I also coach new barristers twice a year at the Bar Practice Course and lecture at the course.\nBefore I came to the Bar I was at Allens for 10 years.  I was responsible for large and complex matters and was under the tutelage of the partners there, many of whom are the very sharpest of practitioners.  I also know what life is like for solicitors so I am sensitive to and respectful of the skills and the needs of those who brief me. \nI have a background in accounting and was at Arthur Andersen & Co for a year as a graduate in 1988.
