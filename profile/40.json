University","location":"Queensland, Australia","connections":"500+","description":"At 21, with less than $1000, I made a radical life-changing decision: to be happy. Instead of allowing a difficult upbringing to define me and keep me down, I instead launched my first business and I have continued to climb higher ever since. \n\nAs a transformational teacher, learning junkie, spiritual being and adventure I have built an international reputation as a hard-charging, rule-breaking, high performance entrepreneur, speaker, and transformational coach. As a certified trainer and facilitator for Mindvalley and Entrepreneur Resorts I am able to combine world class content and methodologies with 2 decades of experience building businesses.\n\nAmong other accolades, I have been honoured as one of StartUp Daily's Top 50 Women Entrepreneurs Under 40, received two Bronze International Stevie Awards for Women in Business, and my Search Firm, Velocity Consulting, was the very first business to receive investment from The Entourage Growth Fund.   \n\nThe difficult upbringing I escaped from, it turned out, was the very thing that allowed me to help others at an even higher level. Possessing a knack for \"reverse engineering\" all aspects of their life, they'd quickly gain clarity on why they were unhappy, but also what needed to change (and how) in order to design a business and a life they truly love. \n\nI have noticed that, again and again, my most financially successful clients were also surprisingly unhappy. They made all the right moves, ticked all the right boxes, but remained fundamentally unfulfilled. So last year I decided it was time to make a difference and help solve this issue by founding Life: Engineered, which helps the founders of fast growth start up businesses reverse engineer all aspects of their life to ensure that they are not only building a successful business that they love but also living a life aligned with their souls true desires.","firstName":"Jade","lastName":"Green"},"jobs":[{"companyName":"The LinkedIn Project","companyUrl":"https://www.linkedin.com/company/14456773/","jobTitle":"Chief LinkedIn Engineer","dateRange":"Jan 2018 – Present","location":"Global","description":"Did you know that 67% of a buyers journey is done digitally. \n74% of B2B + 84% of C level use social media (mainly LinkedIn) to make a purchasing decision and consumes at LEAST 5 pieces of someone’s content before deciding to buy.\n\nIn this 6 week Online Course & Group Mentoring Program you will:\n•Learn how Jade went from 10,000 t0 20,000 genuine connections (and growing at over 100 requests per day) and from maximum 3,000 views to over 50,000 organic views per post in just a few months!\n•Understand why it is imperative you have a strong personal brand and how social proofing affects your ability to close sales & attract talent\n•Gain a blueprint on how to create a LinkedIn profile that has maximum impact and credibility\n•Build your network and learn how to leverage it across multiple platforms and marketing campaigns\n•Discover how to gain testimonials that will position you as an employer and/or supplier of choice\n•Learn specific techniques on how to increase your profile views, search appearances and post views and engagement\n•Take action so that you can start actively attracting business TO you\n•Develop an outreach campaign to reach out directly to customers, partners and talent\n•Start creating content that engages your target market and converts\nAND\n• Gain access to Jade’s LinkedIn Sacred Circle. \nThe Sacred Circle is ONLY for those 100% committed to growing their network, gaining organic traffic and harnessing the power of social selling.

areas of Litigation and have been a part of the Environmental Law section since 2001.\n\nMy clients are mainly Local Government Authorities and as well as providing advice on planning and Local Government matters, I also appear in the Land and Environment Court and Local Court.\n\nThe Marsdens Law Group History:\n\nMarsdens Law Group was founded by John Marsden as a one man practice in 1968. Since he started the firm, John set high standards of service, professionalism and commitment. It was these standards and John's voracious appetite for work and innovation that saw the firm expand, at times rapidly, to become one of the largest firms in the State.\n\nIn that time the practice has grown from a one man, one secretary operation to a firm with almost 150 staff and 4 offices located throughout the Sydney Metropolitan Area. \nThe firm has been successful because it understands that Our Clients Come First. \n\nMarsdens are not simply your average law firm.

Laterite rocks, which are formed through weathering, bear most of the world’s future nickel resources but they are expensive to process with conventional technology, Malnic says.\n\nMost nickel is obtained from other kinds of deposits but these resources are fast being depleted or are too deep to mine, he says. “Nickel is forecast to suffer a supply shortfall from 2017.”\n\nMalnic and his team have made the ­finals of The Australian Innovation Challengeawards with the technology.
