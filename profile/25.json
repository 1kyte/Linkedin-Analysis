About two thirds of this cost results from imbalances where cargo loads are simply one way centric. The other one third is carrier-specific, where the cargo can by definition only be sent one way. \n\nAll carriers understand these issues but may not have the available resource to readily acquire new business back-load cargo. This is where Silverback can assist your company. Many major shipping lines, leasing companies and freight forwarders are currently dealing with Silverback Container Management. For over 20 years Silverback have been successfully reducing repositioning costs for its customers by providing a neutral container interchange network with monitoring systems.\n\nIf your organisation is interested in further reducing its empty container repositioning costs talk to Silverback. Our integrated system opens up domestic as well as global possibilities to reposition your equipment efficiently and cost effectively as well as providing you with one way equipment that was previously out of reach.\n\nThus converting an asset management cost to asset utilisation."}],"schools":[{"schoolUrl":"https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/index/?keywords=Marist%20College","schoolName":"Marist College","dateRange":"1978 – 1981"}],"details":{"linkedinProfile":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/steve-baker-a5b01929","websites":"silverback.com.au"},"skills":[],"allSkills":""},{"general":{"imgUrl":"https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/C5103AQHMtpKkV6jbDg/profile-displayphoto-shrink_800_800/0?e=1545264000&v=beta&t=_ZsWkpbEXic0DXuUPl2d7SKZ5LtkK8gru6sbMCSWiJQ","fullName":"David Gery","headline":"Assistant Section Leader at ALDI Stores Australia","company":"ALDI Stores Australia","school":"The University of Western Australia","location":"Perth, Australia","connections":"500+","description":"Excel at coordinating tasks of numerous internal divisions and external agencies to ensure rapid, accurate delivery of equipment, materials, and resources.
