This allows me to focus on working closely with my team and supporting them to prioritise what needs to be done while completing my own projects in between. \n\nThroughout my working career I’ve held positions in companies large, small, profitable and even not so profitable which has given me experience at all ends of the spectrum. I work best with tangible businesses where I can provide real solutions and drive change end-to-end, from head office to store level. \n\nI have memories of shopping at Coles while growing up and after spending time in the UK I came back to Australia to pursue a senior position in the Coles leadership team. \n\nAs Coles is a company that encourages the opportunity to build a diverse and fulfilling career and embraces the value that finance can contribute to driving the performance of the business, I have had the opportunity to lead and drive change both in our Stores (#goteamvic)  for our customers and also at our Store Support Centre. I work hard to instil a sense of pride into the business and am committed to ensuring that we work to provide value to every customer. \n\nAreas of great importance to me are:\n\nProviding real value to families by reducing the cost of their weekly shop\n\nCreating careers full of diverse opportunities for my team\n\nEnsuring that food quality is of utmost importance in all stores\n\nProviding a safe and empowering environment for our team members\n\nUsing the power of Coles to have a positive impact on the Australian economy and food industry",

I believe that when a person is encouraged with self belief they have the opportunity to fulfill their life ambitions.\n People with disabilities often have more potential than people give them credit for. We are all unique individuals, no one on earth can ever live our own personal experiences.\nLife experiences have taught me many things, one of the most important life lessons is that when you empower another person and watch them grow you also get rewarded.\nWith a life long passion for people with disability, I have a younger brother (Now 38 years old), it is great to see the progress that has been made in recognizing people with disabilities having a valued role in a ever increasing inclusive society.\nAlso a frustrated Landscaper...

This is a remarkable turnaround from 2008 when only 55 percent of residents were satisfied with Council's performance. The majority of residents (63 percent) also agreed we had taken steps to rebuild the community's trust. In customer service, of the 47 percent of respondents who contacted Council in the last year, 83 percent agreed we were easy to contact and the information they received was consistent, clear and easy to understand.  Staff awareness survey results on Fraud and Corruption showed big improvements in understanding Fraud and Corruption, what was being done to prevent it and that we had a zero tolerance.\nSee attachment for details."

In the ordinary course I tailor a staged process to assist parties through the Amalgamation transaction  and subsequent Integration and Optimisation phases;  with supporting communication matrix’s and the like.\n\nMy more general field of expertise is strategic business development and growth in the Community sector.

I have a demonstrated capacity to lead teams of independent Professionals, as well as a diverse range of support staff, to achieve strategic outcomes in both an organisational and altruistic sense.\n\nIn summary I have extensive experience in:-\n\n* Mergers, takeovers and amalgamations\n* Strategic business development and growth\n* Developing new markets and sourcing new clients\n* Public speaking & event management \n* Complex problem solving\n* Day to day applications of Corporate Governance\n\nI provide a no obligation free initial consultation to any Organisation, CEO or director seeking advice on how I may be able to add value to your Organisation.

By October, 2013 its turnover was $32m and it employed 495 people.

Our aim: to provide a holistic approach to family support which meets needs where other organisations can not. Our focus: children at risk or experiencing violence, homelessness and/or abuse. Through our projects we work closely with many agencies providing housing and case management to women and children fleeing domestic and family violence.\n\nMany sweeping changes have occurred in our sector over the past months and our organisation is watching closely as the new landscape begins to unfurl around us. Our intensive projects providing NEW clothing, toiletries, kitchenware, linen, household items, mattresses, toys and refurbished computers to dv/fv and trauma victims and the our local hospitals, have now been passed over to other charities or churches who are continuing this much needed work. \n\nOur current focus:\n\nTraining  – We provide education to professionals and front line workers around complex issues such as :Trauma, Dissociative Disorders and PTSD.  \n\nAdvocacy – We speak out for effective services which protect and support children and young people.  \n\nCounselling – We provide a referral service to a range of specialist counselling services for children and young people to assist recovery from the impact of abuse, family violence and neglect.\n\nCommunity Education – We aim to improve community education around issues of child abuse, family violence, homelessness and mental health issues. \n\nwww.facebook.com/InternationalCommunityAdvocates",

Those issues can only be addressed effectively if compassion fatigue is a part of the prescribed solutions. \n\nIt's imperative that healthcare providers, in particular, address this phenomena and ensure it doesn't get in the way of their practice, or their working environment. \n\nCompassion fatigue is fast becoming a (silent) endemic across the western healthcare system and requires careful consideration along with solid, practical and immediate implementation of new skills, mindsets and approaches to healthcare delivery. \n\nHaving just returned from the world's best conference on compassion fatigue, I'm fresh up with inspiration and the latest means for addressing this issue on our wards and in our private practices. And I want to share this information with those who need it most - frontline staff.\n\nHaving worked with people in trauma most of my career, I've found secondary trauma in helping professionals to be way more prevalent than expected. Secondary trauma is a serious issue and affects many many professionals, especially those who are experienced and competent in their work. Unfortunately, this particular stress response can be overwhelming, causing isolation from peers and those who can help. Which is why I've created a private practice where healing can commence in very private ways. \n\nIf you're an organisation after a better means for addressing staffing issues, consider one of my workshops or individualised sessions for helping your people live and work better. \n\nIf you're an individual and interested in compassion fatigue or think you may have secondary trauma responses going on, get in touch!",

		"description": "Quality Clinical Supervision feels nurturing and you learn helpful stuff from it. Through C.S. your resilience develops further, you grow your understanding of yourself and your unique contribution to your discipline, your patients. \n\nI provide 2 pronged CS that are often interlinked:\n1/ CS for helping the person in trauma\n2/ CS for the professional witnessing trauma\n\nIf you're spending lots of time with people in trauma, you might benefit from specialist CS around secondary trauma. To check, consider how much you're taking your work home - does that affect your relationships, your home life, are you noticing negative changes in your lifestyle? Are you dreaming or nightmaring about what you've experienced at work? Are you finding yourself overly engaged & uncomfortable in providing the care you want to provide? Or maybe you're avoiding important stuff - like the patients, colleagues, or friends'  BBQ's? These aren't always indicators of a trauma response, but certainly impact on your own wellbeing. \n\nSecondary trauma is the trauma experienced by those who help people in direct trauma. It is secondary because it happened to someone else, but the helper is affected through the witnessing, the helping role they play. This is especially an issue for healthcare providers. \n\nIf you feel the need to talk about what's happening at work, then give me a call & we can chat about your needs. And I promise not to push you, or put any hard sells on you! \n\nMy CS technique is gentle and effective (not bullish rah-rah) and is uniquely poised to address the personal transformation that comes through trauma responses & effectively promotes resilience. \n\nIf you'd like to know more about getting through your trauma experience - primary or secondary - get in touch and we can chat."

From the specialist I was sent to a second specialist who then sent me to the Sydney Eye Hospital where it was confirmed that I had MD (Macular Degeneration). I was able to continue working ifor a few years after that, until my eyesight deteriorated to a point where I could no longer meet the high standard that I expected of myself. In the years to follow a did a lot of soul searching trying to come to terms with my vision loss until 2008 I found myself at a Vision Australia’s Gosford Low Vision Clinic and that’s where my life really started for the better. As a client I learnt many new things: learning to use the long cane, computer programmes and other life skills to help me with future employment. I now have a seeing eye dog named \"Echo\" with her by my side we can do anything we put our minds too",

Does it hinder your progress in the world?\n\nAs change is an inevitable part of life we all need to find mature ways to successfully manage both the expected and unexpected adjustments to situations.\n\nThe external world can be challenging.\n\nYet many people also unconsciously self sabotage their own progress in career and love. They don’t allow success to be theirs.\n\nThese people are intelligent, high functioning resources who lack the insight to understand their unconscious machinations.\n\nThey often feel bewildered, fraudulent, frustrated and harshly self critical. They can feel resentful and envious towards others who do move onwards and upwards in their chosen fields. As their confidence decays symptoms of anxiety and depression can manifest. Self soothing is sought which may potentially lead to addictions.\n\nThese addictions may include: alcohol and other drugs, sex, gambling, exercise, food, internet porn, work. All expressions of self sabotage which can lead to risky self defeating cycle of abuse.\n\nBy providing a safe and discrete environment away from corporate and family scrutiny, Dr. Downey helps to create a space for reflection and exploration. He skillfully supports people to be curious as they seek out any hidden and unhelpful beliefs. These beliefs  are considered, deconstructed and, ultimately, replaced with new and more appropriate ones.\n\nThe end result of this curiosity is a personal sense of relief and freedom.\n\nFelling more confident, vital and curious in all facets of their world, these people lead a life of maximum personal and professional success.\n\nWith a background in Medicine, Neuroscience, Psychotherapy and Meditation Dr. Downey is well positioned to assist such people and their circumstances through this journey.\n\nHis continuing professional education and supervision ensures that his clinical skills remain current.",

I have worked in various industries gaining extensive experience in gas exploration, property, not for profits, retail, wholesale, manufacturing, earthmoving, building and mining. I have also gained great experience in presenting financials, building timelines and parental contributions for more fairness in family court matters.\n\nAs a volunteer I am a lived experience educator of parental child abduction (PCA) and parental alienation (PA). I was a child of PCA and PA losing my mother to suicide as a result of the alienation. The whole experience impacted on many parts of my life as a child then later as an adult.\n\nIn Jan 2012 as a separated parent I had my own children abducted interstate. Influenced, forced to lie to professionals and manipulated into rejecting me by their other parent and stepparent. 4 years later my son secretly contacted me and we reunited in Sep 2015, he has been living with me since. Then 2 years later I started secretly meeting with my daughter after 6 years of being isolated and alienated from her.\n\nWith history repeating itself I have had extensive experience that I can now help others with, as well as help educate professionals to better understand the dynamics, tactics and impact of PCA and PA.\n\n•\tIn June 2014 I started a support group for Australian based parents who are alienated from their children with approx. 1000+ members.\n•\tIn January 2015 I founded Parental Alienation Australia Ltd t/as Eeny Meeny Miney Mo Foundation a not for profit that is registered as a health services and advancing education charity,\n•\tIn August 2016 I started a support group for New Zealand based parents who are alienated from their children with approx 150+ members.\n•\tOn the 12 October 2016 our organisations started the 1st Parental Alienation Awareness Day in Australia #PAADay.",

This results in the alienating parent damaging the once positive relationship between the child and the targeted parent. \nThe “alienating parent” can also be a grandparent, a stepparent & even a non-family member. Parental alienation can occur even if the relationship between the targeted child and targeted parent was once a very positive one."

		"description": "He's been a homeless teenager, a soldier in Afghanistan, a gridiron player for Australia, a Churchill Fellow, and he was also a youth worker on call 24/7. After leaving home at 15, Zack couch surfed and spent time on the streets, before he set a goal to join the army which turned his life around. He spent tours of duty in Afghanistan before post-traumatic stress disorder saw him medically discharged. So, Zack set himself another goal – to make the Australian gridiron team within 18 months. Remarkably, he was playing in the World Cup in the United States within 17 months. He then trained as a youth worker, and was YouthCare Canberra’s first full-time outreach worker. With compassion and consistency, Zack helped teens find temporary accommodation, attend court or hospital, overcome drug addictions or transform their lives after time in jail. Zack was supporting and inspiring some of his community’s most disadvantaged and disengaged young people, this was recognised by becoming a multi award winning program.\nIn 2017 he was awarded a Winston Churchill Fellowship to research the \" Cure Violence\" approach to reducing violence within at-risk communities. Where he undertook research in Chicago, Baltimore, Detroit and Rio de Janeiro. He spent two weeks in each location living within severely underprivileged communities and working on the frontline to understand how role models are empowered to use their influence to curb violence in their communities.",

I oversaw the successful implementation of Australia's first fully integrated digital hospital in Hervey Bay as the group CEO of UnitingCare Health in 2014. In 2016 I was asked to be the startup CEO of the newly established Australian Digital Health Agency - putting into practice one of my recommendations from a landmark review and was asked to lead this in 2013 for the Federal Government on digital health in Australia.\n\nKey areas where I want to drive value for the health industry:\n\n- The importance of engaging with customers in the digital health journey\n- The criticality of undertaking change management as an important piece in any digital health implementation program\n- The need to look proactively at the data that can be extracted from digital health platforms to assist management in tracking quality and safety improvements resulting from the digital platforms",

		"description": "I view myself as a development lawyer assisting with planning, property and environment matters.  My environmental science degree enables me to understand environmental legislation and policy at a higher level compared to some lawyers.\n\nIf you have met me, you likely know my mantra is for everyone to “live out loud”.  As an openly gay lawyer, I co-founded McCullough Robertson’s LGBTI+ initiative, McColour.  I also currently sit as the Events Coordinator for Pride in Law, Australia’s first LGBTI+ legal networking association.  I am passionate about LGBTI+ inclusion in the legal industry because I have been told my sexuality would hold back my career along with other demeaning comments.  I will never stop fighting to prove them wrong.\n\nMy passion for a more just society includes several other causes.  I co-founded Australia's first university club aimed at preventing gender-based violence: Griffith Mentors in Violence Prevention.  I also assisted with creating the first bills ever to reform abortion laws in Queensland and co-founded Young Queenslanders for the Right to Choose.  I volunteer several hours every month to the Homeless Persons’ Legal Clinic because the impacts of poverty should never be criminalised.  I have worked with The Legal Forecast for years to increase access to justice through innovation and technology.\n\nSo that’s enough about “Biddy”, please feel free to message me.  I am always keen for a coffee catch up anytime to discuss any of the above and hear more about you.",

Being the first person that new business customers would meet, I helped the business team understand the business needs by asking relevant questions and then providing the right solutions. Through these business interactions, I gained skills in communicating in a professional, but still very personal way.\n\nIn supporting retail operations, I provided amazing customer experiences by translating technology talk into everyday language that could be understood by anyone. These experiences allowed me to build strong relationships with customers, discover their needs and then provide complete solutions, whilst operating under Apple's strict confidentiality agreements. \n\nI have assisted with the launch of key products through the composure I bring to busy environments and the willingness to help out where needed.\n\nThese skills along with my passion for training new team members led to being named a Mentor for the store. In my role as a Mentor, I was responsible for checking in with new staff, reinforcing training materials and acted as a point of reference for technical and customer issues. \n\nI have participated in many zones within the store having presented workshops to tutor newcomers to Apple's technology, provided technical support to resolve customer issues as an Apple Qualified iOS technician and consistently produced results in my position. \n\nThroughout my time at Apple, I was open to feedback from both my peers and managers as it allowed me to grow as a team member and improve workflow."
