Australia","connections":"500+","description":"Leadership is a slippery concept! I believe it is more about disposition than position, and that it is never too early or too late to learn and develop. \n\nVery few leaders are trained in leading – they are promoted to higher levels of responsibility because they are good at what they do. Positive leadership growth involves building 'personal practical knowledge' – embodied, intuitive knowledge accumulated over time through rich, reflective experience. We focus on approaches that build trust and commitment to a shared vision. The energy, influence and alignment which this generates can lead to extraordinary improvement, especially when personal behaviour is scrupulously in accord with core values. \n\nAs our contexts grow more volatile, uncertain, complex and ambiguous, many conventional approaches to leadership challenges disappoint. Rather than our lives being a series of unfolding, empirical events, it can be more helpful to see them as a series of stories we construct to make sense of our experiences. I believe wise leaders are rich in narrative intelligence – shaping and reading the nuanced narratives of their contexts and generating positive action to move agendas forward.\n\nI am a ‘Growth Coaching International’ Accredited Executive Coach, and incorporate strengths-based, solutions-focused coaching approaches in my work.

Passionate about improving the Financial Wellbeing of everyday Australians","company":"Tribeca Financial","school":"Stanford University Graduate School of Business","location":"Melbourne, Australia","connections":"500+","description":"Ryan has always demonstrated a strong work ethic and a commitment to bettering himself. From taking on a paper round from age 11, to working at McDonalds from age 15 and then onto an assortment of jobs to pay his way through university. This work ethic, coupled with the right education stood him in good stead for when he entered into the financial services workforce – just 7 days after his last university exam.\n\nRyan’s passion for financial planning came from a desire to assist others in creating wealth for themselves. \n \nRyan began his financial services career at Mercer, working in their superannuation master trust. He then graduated to an Associate Advisory role at OAMPS, which quickly lead to him becoming a Financial Adviser in his own right. Whilst he found this role rewarding, he knew that he wanted something more, the challenge and rewards of self-employment.\n\nIn 2007, Ryan opened his first financial planning firm. This led to three successful business partnerships with business turnover in excess of $2,000,000. However, as Ryan learnt, most business partnerships have an expiry date.\n\nIn December 2010 Ryan founded Tribeca Financial. It allowed him the opportunity to implement his learnings and ideas from his previous business relationships. Today, Ryan and the young and dynamic team at Tribeca Financial  maintain a dedicated and constant focus on personal client advice. Ryan has now moved into the full-time role of Managing Director at Tribeca Financial and is enjoying the challenge of mentoring a young and enthusiastic advice team. \n\nRyan is extremely passionate about the financial planning industry and bringing young people into it. This is directly reflected in his desire to employ, develop and mentor other financial planning professionals.","firstName":"Ryan","lastName":"Watson"},"jobs":[{"companyName":"Tribeca Financial","companyUrl":"https://www.linkedin.com/company/7724916/","jobTitle":"Founder, Owner and Director","dateRange":"Dec 2010 – Present","location":"Melbourne, Australia","description":null},{"companyName":"Association of Financial Advisers (AFA)","companyUrl":"https://www.linkedin.com/company/3012598/","jobTitle":"Investment Fund Board Member","dateRange":"Apr 2017 – Present","location":"Melbourne, Australia","description":"The AFA Investment Fund exists to manage and grow assets of the AFA which are surplus to operating requirements on a year by year basis.

We live in times when you have to be constantly thinking about what's next, what's new and how do I adapt?\n\nWe live in the age where information moves fast. The workforce is changing.  It’s more digital, more global, diverse, automation-savvy and social media-proficient.  At the same time, business expectations, needs and demands are evolving faster than ever before.\n\nWhile some view this as a challenge,  it’s an opportunity.  An opportunity to reimagine HR, talent, and organisational practices.  An opportunity to create platforms, processes, and tools that will continue to evolve and sustain their value over time.\n\nTo thrive you must organise around information flows.  And when it comes to L&D and learning functions this means to keep up with information flows, you have to ditch hierarchy and embrace truly democratising learning technologies that put tools and knowledge right into the flow of work.\n\nThere's no room for bureaucracy. For successful teams it's about openness, candor, feedback and transparency. If you organise your organisation around these tenets, you’ll thrive. \n\nThis is where 70:20:10 Forum lives.\n\nReach out to me and explore the why, what and how of the 70:20:10 revolution. Or ask me about our corporate program or my exclusive high performance coaching group where I guide you through the challenges and minefields of 70:20:10.\n\nwww.702010Forum.com"},{"companyName":"Harvard Business Publishing","companyUrl":"https://www.linkedin.com/company/1656/","jobTitle":"Managing Director BLENDED (Australia & NZ)","dateRange":"Nov 2001 – May 2015","location":"Australia","description":"Blended Pty Ltd was Harvard Business Publishing's Corporate Learning Global #1\n      \n      Distributor."}],"schools":[{"schoolUrl":"https://www.linkedin.com/school/10231/?legacySchoolId=10231","schoolName":"Monash University","degreeSpec":"International Business","dateRange":"1985 – 1986"}],"details":{"linkedinProfile":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/heatherjrutherford"},"skills":[{"name":"Leadership Development","endorsements":"99+"},{"name":"E-Learning","endorsements":"99+"},{"name":"Blended Learning","endorsements":"99+"},{"name":"Performance Management","endorsements":"61"},{"name":"Change Management","endorsements":"43"},{"name":"Organizational Design","endorsements":"32"},{"name":"Succession Planning","endorsements":"19"},{"name":"Knowledge Management","endorsements":"13"},{"name":"Change management","endorsements":"7"},{"name":"Management Development","endorsements":"76"},{"name":"Leadership","endorsements":"74"},{"name":"Employee Engagement","endorsements":"57"},{"name":"Organizational Development","endorsements":"56"},{"name":"Organizational Effectiveness","endorsements":"45"},{"name":"Management","endorsements":"40"},{"name":"Coaching","endorsements":"33"},{"name":"Executive Coaching","endorsements":"31"},{"name":"Culture Change","endorsements":"30"},{"name":"Talent Management","endorsements":"30"},{"name":"Enablement","endorsements":"6"},{"name":"Workshop Facilitation","endorsements":"41"},{"name":"70:20:10 Enablement","endorsements":"5"}],"allSkills":"Leadership Development, E-Learning, Blended Learning, Performance Management, Change Management, Organizational Design, Succession Planning, Knowledge Management, Change management, Management Development, Leadership, Employee Engagement, Organizational Development, Organizational Effectiveness, Management, Coaching, Executive Coaching, Culture Change, Talent Management, Enablement, Workshop Facilitation, 70:20:10 Enablement"},{"general":{"imgUrl":"https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/C4E03AQHDYmUNtcumNQ/profile-displayphoto-shrink_800_800/0?e=1545264000&v=beta&t=reVHbTivGh_D9HYRh4EuEmE2H_lKCBI2qT7A5gSQXYc","fullName":"Nicholas Vayenas","headline":"HR Consulting  | HR Outsourcing | HR Recruitment","company":"Liquid HR","school":"University of Derby","location":"Sydney, Australia","connections":"500+","description":"A Business Leader and Non-Executive Board Director, with a background in Human Resources Management.\n\nI have comprehensive domestic and international consulting experience in guiding organisations to develop strategic and operational HR efficiencies and outcomes.
