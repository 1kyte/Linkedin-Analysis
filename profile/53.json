		"description": "I have centered my life goals around my passions of learning, helping and guiding others so that I will never work a day in my life! After the completion of my psychology degree in 2015, and my masters degree in counselling and applied psychotherapy at Jansen Newman Institute (Torrens University), I now look forward to undertaking my PhD one day within the near future.\n\nMy main interest is to conduct research into what drives human attraction besides physical attraction and personality/emotional attraction. As the two have the ability to continually change throughout one’s lifetime, this means that attraction is subject to change when one or both individuals change, either falling deeper in love or falling apart. My other interests include working with families helping and coaching them to work cohesively, working with students who are struggling academically, and conducting research on controversial issues in aim of raising awareness (articles which are accessible via LinkedIn). \n\nWhen working, I work on the premise that therapy should be an open dialogue between two individuals, understanding that people come from many different walks of life and different experiences. I believe that a collaborative and conversational oriented approach through a shared dialogue – like that of narrative therapy and/or Imago therapy is the best way to engage with my client’s presenting concerns. \n\nFor more information about who I am and what I love doing, please feel free to email me on LinkedIn or my personal email: daniella.ghossein@outlook.com. I look forward to networking with you.",

As a follow-up engagement, we can develop and execute an Implementation Plan.\n\nMost of our clients are in Melbourne, Geelong and south-west Victoria.

We are a boutique wills & estates firm based in Sydney's CBD.\n\nOur experience encompasses all things wills & estates, including:\n\n- drafting complex wills with/without testamentary trusts and ancillary documents, such as enduring powers of attorney and appointment of enduring guardianship documents\n\n- obtaining probate in common and solemn form, and grants for informal wills\n\n- obtaining letters of administration with/without the will annexed\n\n- facilitating the administration of complex estates\n\n- drafting civil and administrative tribunal applications\n\n- acting for plaintiffs and defendants in family provision claims and other will disputes.\n\nI have prepared estate plans for clients with estates valued from $50,000 to $150,000,000 and everything in between.\n\nI was the first solicitor in NSW to bring a claim under Part 4.4 of the Succession Act 2006 NSW which was disputed.  I was successful in obtaining a distribution order in favour of my client which took precedence over the general intestacy rules under Part 4.3 of the act.  See Re Estate Jerrard, deceased [2018] NSWSC 781\n\nFor excellence in wills & estates advice, or to have a chat with the wills & estates guru himself, give us a call.",

Now, as an owner and Director of Lavish International P/L and MiaBelle Luxury Fragrances I am looking to establish long term and mutually beneficial relationships with my retail clients as well as our corporate clients in Real Estate, across Melbourne and Victoria. \n\nI am interested in networking and connecting with Real-Estate and Property professionals, including all corporate companies who take pride in their gift giving.

I have successfully secured not guilty verdicts for ADF members in multiple serious complex trials, either at court martial, or before the Supreme and District Courts of NSW since 1993.\n\nFor instance, in 2014  I appeared as Defending Officer on behalf of one of the four Able Seamen ABMT accused who appeared before the longest running General Court Martial (GCM) in Australian history of 9 weeks (the HMAS NEWCASTLE GCM) for the alleged offences of sexual intercourse without consent, act of indecency, assault on a service ship, forcible confinement and prejudicial conduct. I secured acquittals for my client on all 5 charges after verdicts by direction were given to the GCM by the Judge Advocate on the primary counts of sexual intercourse without consent and act of indecency.\n\nIn 2015-2016 I appeared on behalf of a second  of the four accused from the HMAS NEWCASTLE GCM, who had his convictions quashed for the charges of act of indecency and forcible confinement  by the Defence Force Discipline Appeals Tribunal on 27 Mar 17 (Angre v. Chief of Navy (No.3) [2017] ADFDAT 2). \n\nThe Tribunal held that his pleas of guilty on these charges were induced during a plea bargain by a misrepresentation by the prosecution that he would be sentenced by a Defence Force Magistrate rather than a GCM. The Tribunal held that \"To hold  Able Seaman Angre to a plea of guilty entered on that basis, when he had no genuine consciousness of guilt , would be a grave miscarriage of justice.\"   \n\nIn 2016 I appeared as Prosecuting Officer on behalf of the DIrector of Military Prosecutions in a successful prosecution which was the longest running Restricted Court Martial (RCM) of 12 weeks in Australian history, in relation to allegations of unauthorized access to restricted data by an Army WO in the UAE."

This mission was made possible by the collaboration of two businesses: Investment One and Property Way.\n\nFellow Co-Founder Julian Muldoon and I had worked collaboratively across our Melbourne and Sydney based businesses for a number of years, supporting each other’s clients, whilst also sharing strategic direction and research. Most importantly, Julian and I share a common vision to be the most trusted people in Real Estate.\n\nIt was a natural progression to join forces and create one firm that has extensive expertise and resources, operating in capital cities across the Eastern seaboard which now includes our expansion into Brisbane. \n\n1Group is both big enough to offer you a comprehensive service and cutting-edge research, whilst being small enough to remain personal and nimble in the market. Our team provides a boutique level of service, but with the knowledge, resources and skill set of a large agency. \n\nWe inspire genuine relationships with every client and provide a service where trusted advisors always have your best interests at heart.",

The school holidays saw her working for her parents.  \n\nAfter completing a Business & Marketing degree at the University of Western Sydney and securing a job at an international company Elyse thought she had ‘made it’. However, she soon came to the realisation that she enjoyed the variety working in a small business offered and figured she might be suited to a smaller company where she would be able to offer her skills across a variety of areas in the business instead of specialising only in marketing. \n\nAt 20 she joined the family business in promotional products full-time and while there learnt the importance of personalisation and the demand for custom products. She saw an opportunity to sell jackets that were designed by the customer and customised inside and out focusing on the leavers wear market and community groups. In August 2009 she took her first order of custom jackets and with that Exodus Wear was born. \n\nFrom there it was a quick transition to full-time entrepreneur but a long journey with many ups and downs to reach the point of running a multi-million dollar company servicing Australia wide. With highlights such as having Justin Bieber wear one of her jackets to learning first hand the pitfalls of sourcing direct from China every day the business teaches her something new. \n\nIn 2017 she took her passion for video and create a YouTube Channel with weekly vlogs and how-to's and tutorials to help other people get started in video.",

		"description": "Exodus Wear are one of the leading producers of leavers wear garments and custom dance tour jackets in Australia. \n\nWhat are leavers wear garments?\n\nIn Australia we have a tradition that when you go into your senior year of High School you get the privilege of being able to wear a jacket or jersey that is different to the standard school uniform. It is typically personalised with a nickname of your choice which many students spend hours deciding which name to pick. It is a big decision to a 17 year old as it will be on display for everyone to see for a whole year (we have seen a few crazy ones over the year and often have to refer to urbandictionary.com to decipher what some mean!)  \n\nWe ourselves had never heard of dance tours until we made our first dance tour jackets. We work with dance schools who are going overseas to perform or study typically at one of the major theme parks like Disneyland. \n\nWe are constantly pushing the boundaries to make our jackets the most customisable on the market. We are famous for customising our jackets inside and out and in particular for our custom lining. The rule with our lining is that there is no rule! Whether you want to print your students names, a repeat pattern of your logo or even photos it is all possible. \n\nIf you are unsure about how you would like your custom jacket to look our team can create designs for you and we even offer a free, no-obligation physical pre-production sample so that you can see your jacket in real life before placing an order. \n\nOur jackets are so popular they have been worn by Justin Bieber, Justice Crew, Kyle Sandilands, Stan Walker, Jedward, Israel Cruz and many more. Check out the photos below. \n\nWith a current focus on expanding internationally to the USA, Hong Kong and New Zealand we are looking for Manufacturer's Representatives and Independent Sales Agents to represent us with current experience selling to High Schools, Sororities, Fraternities and the Dance industry."

Although initially this was for education purposes it became an invaluable skill when it came to property due diligence.

In addition to substantive rules, EU law imposes procedural obligations on national courts, state bodies and administrative authorities to ensure its effective implementation. It further provides mechanisms by which individuals and entities may seek redress for breaches. Following the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty, the EU’s Charter of fundamental rights guarantees a wide-ranging set of rights, freedoms and principles and enumerates primary legal norms against which secondary EU legislation and national implementing measures may be interpreted, a lot of which most general practitioners do not appreciate."

		"description": "After practising law for several years I studied a post graduate degree in IT. This led to the development of www.cpdinteractive.com.au which provides online professional development for lawyers, including ethics, legal skills and practice management. After 20 years of delivering legal education I realised my number one love is education. This led to the development of VidVersity. As an educator I had been looking for an easy yet effective way to build online learning, that does not require a technical team, but rather me as an educator can develop myself. So after many years of research and development I together with Simon Quirk developed VidVersity.\n\nIn 2008, I started CPD Interactive. The core aim of this company was to drive quality, cost effective online professional development in Australia. It offers a broad suite of Continuing Professional Development and Continuing Legal Education training courses for lawyers for you and your firm to choose from. Clients include Herbert Smith Freehills, Lander & Rogers, Slater & Gordon, King Wood Mallesons and many more. in June 2018 CPD Interactive was acquired by The College of Law.\n\nWe also offer bespoke online training courses for all government and private sector clients with a focus on compliance and inductions.\n \nI also been providing consulting services in the area of legal research to firms through Bliss Consulting since 1999. \n\nI am also a Legal Research Skills Adviser at Melbourne University Law School to both Masters and JD students. \n\n\nI also developed a legal research app called LawSauce, in partnership with Ruth Bird of Oxford University.\n\nSpecialties: Legal research, elearning, law, Professional Development for lawyers, instructional design, legal skills, conducting legal research.",

However I try to focus on building quality into all stages of the product development cycle . The QA teams I've worked with started off being post-development testing teams, focusing on regression testing applications built by teams prior to pushing code to production.\n\nMy goal has been to reduce the number of stand-alone QA's, not increase them. To embed good agile practices across the organisation and identify and eliminate any 'over the wall' behaviour the engineering teams have. If the organisation has a 'stand-alone' QA team, and a long post-engineering testing cycle, they are doing software WRONG!\n\nQA as a standalone practise is actually a common sign of waste in software engineering, so eliminating waste should be every 'agile' teams goals. Agile teams need to consider 'quality' as building the thing right in the first place. This helps the team move on from separate 'checking' steps in their process. Quality is everyones responsibility, not just the testers."

		"description": "To combat the lack of pocket money from my parents, I would sell soft drinks out of my locker in high school with another high school business partner. At first, it was a few cans here and there, but the demand quickly grew and within a month, we had outfit our locker to ensure the cans remained cold using cooler packs taped to the inside walls. Selling 48 cans at $1 each per day, I was making about $150 profit a week. \n\nI discovered my flair for business and begun to sell lolly bags and chocolate coated marshmallows and strawberries, made in the high school kitchens. I even enlisted a business partner to help with the demand and sold them during lunch. \n\nSeveral months later, my school caught wind and shut me down for the selling of 'contraband' soft drinks and snacks with the PTA unhappy with the decrease in school canteen profits, but not before making over $2000 in profits.\n\nIn 2017, I graduated from the ANU with a double degree of Bachelor of Laws (Honours) / Bachelor of Science in Chemistry, and whilst I've put the soft-drink selling industry behind me, I'm looking to apply my problem solving skills to develop business strategy and tackle the issues posed by disruptive technologies. \n\nDuring my final year, I wrote my Law thesis on blockchain regulation and law reform to regulate the impact of blockchain on the Australian financial market, specifically examining the shift from the ASX's CHESS to Blockchain Clearing and Settlement and how Ch 7 of the Corporations Act should be reformed to accommodate this shift. \n\nOutside of my university studies, I am an avid travel photographer and have had photos published by various travel agents. I invest on the ASX recreationally and whilst at university, I wrote a weekly article for Woroni, the student newspaper, on weekly 'stock picks'. \n\nIn my spare time,  I enjoy cooking (in particular baking and anything flour related), trail running and backseat coaching basketball and tennis from the comfort of my lounge room.",

The results showed that students desire guidance from a learning system and support from their instructors to flexibly fit around their busy schedules.I have published several aspects of my Ph.D. research, including in the prestigious Information & Management journal (ranked A* by the Australian Business Deans Council).
