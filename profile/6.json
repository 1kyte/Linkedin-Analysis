My primary responsibilities included the cataloguing and editing of images for use in the publication. This involved liaison with public, private, national and international collections as well as direct collaboration with Jilamara Arts & Crafts Association.\n\nAcknowledgements (Page 175)\nEditorial Team\nMelanie Tannin, Editorial Assistant, Seva Frangos Art, Perth\n“Working alongside an emerging art historian was a pleasure. Resourceful, committed and organised well beyond my own capacity at times, Melanie Tannin undertook the daunting task of all image permissions and details. Working closely with Jilamara Arts & Crafts Association, together they were able to overcome incomplete record systems and pursued every possible avenue in identifying, clarifying and confirming source material. It required Tannin’s persistence, patience and energy. Each step in carefully compiling the material was successfully undertaken with poise. Acquiring the large number of permissions has been her triumph, and belies her youthfulness. She approached the task with consideration, efficiency and lateral thinking, as much of the required information originated in remote Indigenous Australia but was ultimately scattered throughout the world.  Tannin willingly contributed to every aspect of the monograph with intelligence and original insights and graciously accepted the role of sounding board and secretary. Importantly, she is a fan of Timothy Cook and this was obvious in her sensitivity and mindfulness in responding to images and text.”"},{"companyName":"Seva Frangos Art","companyUrl":"https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/index/?keywords=Seva%20Frangos%20Art","jobTitle":"Gallery Assistant","dateRange":"Nov 2012 – Jun 2014","location":"Perth, Australia","description":"Responsibilities and achievements\n      \n\n    - Maintaining and updating gallery website (WordPress).\n      \n\n    - Client and artist liaison.\n      \n\n    \n      - Editing.\n\n...

While it may be said the law is dry, the firm is dynamic and buzzing. It is filled with people who really enjoy what they do and are happy to share their breadth of experience and ideas to ensure the best outcome for clients. Working in such an environment it is easy come into the office each day to do your best. \n\nMy main area of practice is Statutory Benefits which regularly has me up at the Melbourne Magistrates’ Court. We deal with all aspects of the Accident Compensation Act 1985 and Workplace Injury Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 2013.   My practice also includes Judicial Review applications in the Supreme Court of Victoria. \n\nI recently completed a secondment with the Compensation Management Team at National Disability Insurance Agency. The role required statutory interpretation, drafting of policy and procedure as well as development of resources and implementation of standard operating procedures. \n\nAs a litigator and legal adviser, I approach my practice with a keen eye for detail, a positive attitude and a willingness to share ideas and listen. I believe the best results are achieved through early and regular communication and open and honest advice.","firstName":"Bernard","lastName":"Glass"},"jobs":[{"companyName":"Wisewould
