[{"general":{"fullName":"Romana Shah","headline":"HR Assistant at Independent Recruiter","company":"Independent Recruiter","school":"SKM Public School","location":"New Delhi, Delhi, India","connections":"500+","description":"As recruiters, I believe in working a local area and having face to face contact with the hiring manager is the key to building relationships. When you meet your clients, you see their face, agony and need that they really need to hire that exceptional person that they can't find. Secondly, if we decide to meet every single client, we form a better relationship with the company that has the potential of providing you (the recruiter) more job orders. Recruiters always think the phone should be the extension of your hand as recruiters should be on the phone all day long. I don't disagree with this philosophy but as social media , e-mail and text messaging are getting more prevalent, sometimes e-mailing a client combined with ONE or TWO follow up phone call is the right approach. (Phoning one client too many times or phoning one client five to ten times on a Monday morning) might just ruin that relationship that took 5 to 6 years to build.","firstName":"Romana","lastName":"Shah"},"jobs":[{"companyName":"Independent Recruiter","companyUrl":"https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/index/?keywords=Independent%20Recruiter","jobTitle":"HR Assistant","dateRange":"Feb 2013 – Present","location":null,"description":"Performs a full scope of activities associated with the development and conduct of comprehensive recruiting and employment of new employees.

\n\nMy name is Eron. \nI'm a recruiter, and I'm actually damn proud about it. \n\nTo tell you a little more about me, I started my career initially in 2010 as a Digital Marketer in a local Brisbane digital agency running PPC campaigns for a sizeable portfolio of SME’s. After a year of doing that, I then completely pivoted into a Human Resources Manager role at that very same agency, and I’m proud to say I played a big part in enabling the business to scale before it internationalized. \n\nAfter being in a digital environment for over five years recruiting for all sorts of cool roles internally, I decided that I should try my hand at agency recruitment, which is an unlikely career trajectory, I know. Fortunately for me, I discovered that I loved it and by absolute luck, I've landed my dream role as a member of the affix crew, where I'm one of the foundation members of the Brisbane office! \n\nAt affix, we hang out in the Digital and Technology space where our purpose is to help businesses of all shapes and sizes scale their teams by finding them wonderful humans and offer them a genuine recruitment alternative. What's my role in all of this? I play an important part in helping people find their happy place at work. That's right, I get to change lives for a living 🌎⭐️🙌🏽\n\nOutside of affix, I'm a proud mama and a wife. I love great food, a good Pinot, a sneaky G&T, 90's hip-hop, travel, and I adore having real conversations with real people. \n\nI'm super approachable and everyone who knows me will testify that I love a good chat. If you’d like to get to know me more or if you think there’s a way we could help one and other, then let’s talk.\n\neron.castro@affix.com.au || 0401 002 988","firstName":"Eron","lastName":"Castro"},"jobs":[{"companyName":"affix","companyUrl":"https://www.linkedin.com/company/6591776/","jobTitle":"Digital & Marketing Recruiter","dateRange":"Mar 2018 – Present","location":"Brisbane, Australia","description":"At affix - we’re leading the way for positive change in the market, taking a game changing approach to partnering with our customers.

Nutanix has been the most challenging, rewarding and empowering experience for which I will forever be grateful.  Even more exciting is the fact the journey has just begun. The groundwork has been laid for the next chapter with Nutanix as validated by the recent Gartner Magic Quadrant for HCI, our Q2 FY18 earnings report, and our guidance from business and technical perspectives, which provide quantifiable customer and partner benefits. \n\nEntering 2018, I am humbled by the reflection my IT career began 21 years ago in Austin, Texas.  I often wonder today what advice I would give that young Inside Sales Rep working from the infamous Round Rock campus when Compaq was the king of servers and Apple was struggling to stay alive.  One important note is many of the colleagues whom I shared those experiences with in the late ‘90s are still close friends today. \n\nFor 16 years I have been based in Sydney but through my experiences with Dell, EMC and Nutanix I have built and maintained a substantial network of partners and colleagues across the Asia Pacific theatre. I have leveraged this network extensively in Australia, China, Hong Kong, Japan and Singapore as my APJ Inside Sales Team approaches 8x growth in headcount from our start in February 2016. The incremental value of revenue and demand generation delivered to our partners and Nutanix is only limited by how quickly we can hire. \n\nIf you are ready to begin the next chapter of your IT career, please feel free to contact me with any questions.  My team members both past and present will tell you I put my team first and make a personal investment to ensure their professional growth.","firstName":"Ted","lastName":"Tarpley"},"jobs":[{"companyName":"Nutanix","companyUrl":"https://www.linkedin.com/company/735085/","jobTitle":"Senior Manager, Inside Sales - Asia Pacific and

After graduating high school, she worked three jobs, seven days a week, until buying her first house at 18. By 21, Gennavieve had properties in 3 countries, and the rest is history!\n\nGennavieve holds several qualifications, including Certificates in Business, Management, Life Coaching and a Bachelor's degree in Journalism, which she put to good use as a News Reader with several Queensland radio stations before moving to Perth.\n\nDespite loving life in radio, at the end of the day it was still a job she was required to attend, day in day out, and (as you will come to learn) the thought of that has never sat right with her – her job was restricting her time and financial ability to give back to the world.\n\nUpon moving to Perth, she made the conscious decision to step away from Journalism. Instead, spending almost every dollar and waking hour gaining a solid financial education and reigniting her love for property.\n\nNow, as an active Australian & International property investor, Gennavieve spends her time traveling, predominantly split between Australia and America, where she ‘flips properties’ for fun, giving her the freedom she was after to help and educate others to live a life on their terms as well.\n\nIt is Gennavieve’s thirst for learning and watching others achieve that ‘light bulb’ moment that lead her to this point and the creation of Lyons Property Mentoring. With clients and subscribers coming from all walks of life, with amazing stories, knowledge and experience.\n\nFor those who are looking to gain something extra from their lives, Gennavieve is always more than happy to share her journey with you in the hope of bringing some inspiration (or humour, there’s been a lot of mistakes!) to your day, but more importantly to help you progress towards your own ‘Why’.

There was a need for people to be TAUGHT ABOUT INVESTING, BY AN ACTIVE INVESTOR, that covers not just where and how to buy property, but how to get through life as an investor- how to train your mindset to handle the ups and downs and live a life most people can’t get their head around because they are taught to be a slave to the system.\n\nWe’re proud to say that today, we have created just that with Lyons Property Mentoring’s Training Ring!
