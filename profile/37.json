I initiated this two-day event that allowed students from the School of Law, School of IT and School of Business to work together to create tech-based solutions to issues in the legal industry. The competition aimed to incorporate greater interdisciplinary collaboration, critical thinking and technology into the existing tertiary curriculum. The Hackathon was also the first interdisciplinary legal hackathon in WA."},{"companyName":"King & Wood Mallesons","companyUrl":"https://www.linkedin.com/company/9206/","jobTitle":"Vacation Clerk","dateRange":"Jun 2018 – Jul 2018","location":"Perth, Australia","description":"Real Estate"},{"companyName":"Johnson Winter & Slattery","companyUrl":"https://www.linkedin.com/company/63970/","jobTitle":"Vacation clerk","dateRange":"Feb 2018 – Mar 2018","location":"Perth, Australia","description":null},{"companyName":"MinterEllison","companyUrl":"https://www.linkedin.com/company/7928/","jobTitle":"Vacation Clerk","dateRange":"Jan 2018 – Feb 2018","location":"Perth, Australia","description":"Litigation & Dispute Resolution"},{"companyName":"Jackson McDonald","companyUrl":"https://www.linkedin.com/company/1083736/","jobTitle":"Office Services Administrator","dateRange":"Oct 2017 – Jan 2018","location":"Perth, Australia","description":"I assisted with the provision of general administrative support."},{"companyName":"K&L Gates","companyUrl":"https://www.linkedin.com/company/164569/","jobTitle":"Seasonal Clerk","dateRange":"Nov 2017 – Dec 2017","location":"Perth, Australia","description":"Labour, Employment and Workplace Safety"},{"companyName":"DLA Piper","companyUrl":"https://www.linkedin.com/company/4422/","jobTitle":"Vacation Clerk","dateRange":"Jun 2017 – Jul 2017","location":null,"description":"Employment"},{"companyName":"Irwin Legal","companyUrl":"https://www.linkedin.com/company/6578045/","jobTitle":"Paralegal","dateRange":"Apr 2017 – Jul 2017","location":"Perth, Australia","description":null},{"companyName":"SCALES-Human Rights Clinic","companyUrl":"https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/index/?keywords=SCALES-Human%20Rights%20Clinic","jobTitle":"Paralegal","dateRange":"Jan 2017 – Apr 2017","location":"Perth, Australia","description":"In my role, I assisted migration lawyers with legal research into character provisions,\n      drafted statutory declarations, conducted client interviews with refugees and liaised\n      \n      with their interpreters."}],"schools":[{"schoolUrl":"https://www.linkedin.com/school/10232/?legacySchoolId=10232","schoolName":"Murdoch University","degree":"Bachelor’s Degree","degreeSpec":"Bachelor of Laws / Bachelor of International Business","dateRange":"2014 – 2019","description":"2018 Students as Change Agents for Learning and Teaching Program2017 Vice Chancellor’s Commendation for Academic Excellence2017 Quarter-Finalist - Hon.

For the Honours Program I examined three areas of law that hold special interest for me: health care, privacy and policy. My more narrowly defined thesis explored the the application of the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth) to the medical use of digital imagery with specific reference to contemporary dermatology and primary care practice. My thesis identified the emerging differences between the legislation and the practices surrounding the rapid adoption of digital technology in Australian health care.\n\nLaw school has been both exciting and challenging. Coming from a more structured retail banking background, I had to overcome my reticence to present my ideas publicly. I successfully competed in Murdoch’s Trial Advocacy Competition, joined the Moot Court Bench, and presented the case for a refugee immigration visa case through Murdoch’s SCALES pro bono service. \n\nOne of the greatest satisfactions of a recently completed clerkship was that my training and tenacity enabled me to provide research product sufficiently thorough to be used by my supervisors when advising the client and preparing court briefs / submissions. For me, no exam result could match this simple marker of skills acquired. \n\nI am currently a Judge's Associate at the Supreme Court of Western Australia.","firstName":"Scarlette","lastName":"de

lawyer at a leading international law firm. While law was a wonderful launching pad affording her several years of invaluable learning and development both in Australia and overseas, it became increasingly difficult for her to balance the demanding professional lifestyle with her more creative and adventurous impulses. When she and her partner Nicholas started a small health food business, Matcha Maiden, as a humble side project Sarah discovered her passion in fact lies where she can flex her creative muscles, indulge her love for human interaction and work from new and exciting places everyday. Fortunately, the pair had stumbled across a sizeable gap in the domestic and international markets and found themselves running a booming global business in a matter of months, allowing Sarah to hang up the suits and heels to step into the business full-time as a blossoming \"funtrepreneur\".","firstName":"Sarah","lastName":"Holloway"},"jobs":[{"companyName":"Matcha Mylkbar","companyUrl":"https://www.linkedin.com/company/7949823/","jobTitle":"Co Owner","dateRange":"Mar 2016 – Present","location":"72 Acland St, St Kilda","description":"Matcha Mylkbar is Australia's first specialty matcha cafe showcasing this vibrant green superfood as well as a world leading, innovative plant-based breakfast and lunch menu. There are five \"Blue Zones\" in the world where people live longer than anywhere else and the primary factor they share in common is a majority plant-based diet - not because of any moral/ethical/political concerns but simply due to what is sustainable. Okinawa, Japan is one of the five zones and has the highest number of centenarians in the world, largely due to a plant-based diet and high levels of matcha consumption. Matcha Mylkbar's menu is built around this research and a philosophy of putting the sustainability and longevity benefits of plant based eating at the Melbourne cafe culture's disposal in a way that takes the moral/political/ethical elements and stigma away from vegan dining. \n\nEach dish is designed to please all palates, preferences and dietary requirements. We have even developed a \"vegan egg\" made wholly of plant based materials but with the same consistency and texture of a regular egg. This is culinary innovation as you've never seen it before! The beverages are equally as progressive featuring Melbourne's first beetroot and mushroom lattes and, of course, a host of matcha themed drinks.

In its ceremonial form, it is prepared using a bamboo whisk with hot water as part of the traditional Japanese tea ceremony ritual. Until recently, it was perceived as a special occasion indulgence and wasn't widely recognised beyond the tea realm nor was it affordable or accessible to the masses. That was, of course, until the birth of Matcha Maiden in late November 2014.\n\nSarah and her partner, Nic, were surprised to find this vibrant green powder had not yet taken off in the health food world. It sounds complicated and fancy, but it’s actually quite simple – matcha is purely green tea leaves ground into powdered form. Because it is so concentrated, you can get up to 137 x the antioxidants of regular green tea per serve and up to 10 x the overall nutritional content. Its powdered form also lends it to uses far more creative than a plain tea, so Nic and Sarah set out to change the world's perception of matcha powder shifting it from a \"ceremonial tea\" to a \"daily use superfood\". Just over a year later, Matcha Maiden has warehouses both in Australia and the US, over 1000+ physical stockists around the world, almost 100,000 followers, a team of staff and interns and a soon-to-open physical matcha specialty cafe."},{"companyName":"King & Wood Mallesons","companyUrl":"https://www.linkedin.com/company/9206/","jobTitle":"Solicitor","dateRange":"Feb 2013 – Nov
