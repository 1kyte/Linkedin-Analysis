What Values will guide you? And how does this translate into actions? How can you create and lead ethical systems?\n\nMy coaching addresses the alignment question – are you habitually acting in alignment with your Vision? Are you telling a supportive story to yourself?\n\nThe presentations I deliver aim to challenge thing by showing alternative ways of viewing reality.\n\nMy current research explores “Why Good People Do Bad Things” and I welcome new opportunities to work with inspiring people and organisations on ethics and governance issues.

One that sees a new way of leadership that recognises that who leaders are “being” rather than what they are “doing” is what creates long term sustainable results that benefit all.\n\nThis global paradigm shift happening in the world of business is moving from a pure profit & shareholder focus...to a purpose, people & all stakeholder focus. In essence this means that business is moving on from being only interested in making a profit to return to its shareholders. The new business paradigm holds the promise for business to deliver value toward a shared vision and purpose far beyond profit alone. One that creates value for all stakeholders, creating a better future for all. Doing better business, as a force for good and achieving exceptional results in the process.\n\nWith over twenty years in senior sales, partner management and management roles in the Telecommunications, IT and Wellness Services sectors, Aurora has been recognised with global and local business awards of excellence in companies such as BellSouth, IBM, Telstra and Optus.\n\nNow as the founder of She Speaks and as a leadership coach, facilitator and presenter, it is Aurora’s passion to support leaders in their own self actualisation process to enable them to create more humanity in business through inspired self-aware leadership and allow for business to truly be a force for good. \n\nAurora is one of the creators of the Self-Aware Leaders Program and is also a founding member of Conscious Capitalism and Humanity In business.","firstName":"Aurora","lastName":"Pagonis"},"jobs":[{"companyName":"She Speaks - Global Mindful Leadership Development","companyUrl":"https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/index/?keywords=She%20Speaks%20-%20Global%20Mindful%20Leadership%20Development","jobTitle":"Mindful Leadership & Living Coach, Facilitator, Speaker & Inspirational Changemaker","dateRange":"Feb 2013 – Present","location":"sydney area, australia","description":"She Speaks was created to support Leaders & Changemakers to create the new paradigm of business through Self- Aware Mindful Leadership Development.\n\nThis new paradigm of a business means a shift away from a profit only shareholder focus to a purpose, people, all stakeholder focus. As a result of this shift companies today face at least 3 new realities :-'\n\n1. The pace of change in business is now too rapid to respond by using traditional thinking. Leaders can no longer 'manage change' but need to create their own future. \n2. There is now a level of transparency required in business like never before. People demand authenticity. \n3. There has been a shift in people away from acquisition to meaning. People want to interact with companies whose values they buy into.\n\nThese shifts have created the opportunity for a new paradigm of leadership. One that is Self -Aware, authentic, purposeful, and values based. She Speaks supports this shift by inspiring and developing leaders to lead in a new way, by offering a customised range of Emotional Intelligence and Self- Aware Leadership coaching and workshop initiatives.To enable this style of leadership, leaders must be willing to experience there own self actualisation process.\n\n A Self-Aware leader takes 100 % responsibility, lives on purpose, leads by inspiration, walks their talk, doesn’t ever compromise human values for material success, speaks their truth with honesty and respect, honors commitments impeccably, listens to others with humility, resolves disagreements attending to all concerns, accepts their emotions and expresses them constructively.\n\nThe Self-Aware Leaders coaching program Program awakens leadership through an inside out awareness approach to discover how leaders can outperform the market and become change agents for the greater good."},{"companyName":"Mindset Group","companyUrl":"https://www.linkedin.com/company/234160/","jobTitle":"Engagement Manager","dateRange":"May 2012 – Nov 2012","location":"Sydney, Australia","description":"Transformation / Talent /Technology Services.

University","location":"Brisbane, Australia","connections":"500+","description":"I was crazy enough to start a business in the GFC, opening a Brisbane executive recruitment & search business with co-founder Efren. We scaled the business nationally & then sold the brand in April 2017; so I understand how having the right people on board, the right process & plan is critical to continued businesses growth & success. \n\nWhen expanding the business, offshoring the administrative function to the Philippines was recommended. So, three years ago, we took the plunge & decided to offshore our back office to the Philippines, viewing this as the most cost-effective way to upscale our business while retaining control of our high-quality output & standard of service.\n\nOriginally, we were hesitant, & without the proper understanding of offshoring or support, we made a lot of mistakes - some obvious, some surprising - that cost us considerable time & money.  However, we learnt from our mistakes & built processes to make sure they didn’t happen again.\n\nAnd then a surprising thing happened to us - our customers noticed what we were doing & asked us to help them with offshoring.  As most businesses in the competitive SMB market, they too were fighting to stay competitive, & saw offshoring as a way of staying in the game.  \n\nAt FiltaGlobal, we'll teach you everything you need to know about building and managing global teams that actually work.\n\nWe help small to medium sized companies in Australia & New Zealand, save on staffing costs without sacrificing work quality by finding, attracting, and keeping the best talent both in Australia and in the Philippines. We also work closely with our customers to help get the best out of their global teams and create environments where staff can thrive, no matter where on earth they are.\n\nI’m also an active speaker on the topics of offshoring & recruitment & as a guest lecturer at QUT Business School.  I’ve been profiled in The Sydney Morning Herald, The Courier Mail & Quest newspapers & radio including 4BC, B105, Nova 106.9","firstName":"Nerissa","lastName":"Chaux"},"jobs":[{"companyName":"FiltaGlobal Pty Ltd","companyUrl":"https://www.linkedin.com/company/16199933/","jobTitle":"Co-Founder | Director","dateRange":"Sep 2016 – Present","location":"Brisbane, Australia","description":"We'll teach you everything you need to know about building and managing global teams that actually work.\n\nWe help small to medium sized companies save on staffing costs without sacrificing work quality by finding, attracting, and keeping the best talent both in Australia and in the Philippines.
