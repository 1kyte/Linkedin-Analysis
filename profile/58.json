It takes courage for both spouses to control their emotions and reconstruct their lives without damaging themselves and their children following separation. Fear can overwhelm people and prevent them from working constructively after family breakdown. Wise family lawyers understand the common challenges that people face; emotional and practical, and guide them through the legal negotiations.\n\n* \"Old school\" lawyers mainly talk about rights and entitlements. That's fine when you are in Court however most clients don't want to go to Court. Wise family law professionals including experienced Mediators and Collaborative Lawyers help clients to talk about their goals and concerns. Their clients will say “I want an outcome that works for us and the children, negotiation based on open communication, sharing documents and filling in knowledge gaps. Agreements must work for all of the family even if we no longer live together.”\n\n* I am a Mediator (NMAS). When people talk, I listen! I specialise in the evaluative mediation of financial cases (big and small.) I also mediate parenting cases when people are in Court and they want or need to reach a resolution before a Judge makes the final decision.\n\n* I am also a Litigator; experienced in obtaining good results in Court. Yet I call litigation \"old technology.\" Not old as in bad or worn, but “old” when compared to modern ways of \"lawyering\"; ie lawyers helping people in ways that don’t have to unsettle or harm their relationships. Some cases however still require a Judge. My colleagues and I in the Family and Relationships Law team at Gadens provide advice and Court representation that is highly valued by our clients and very well respected within the legal profession. \n\n*Whether we are at Court or being an advocate at Collaborative or mediation meetings, we strive for the best results- for every client.","firstName":"Paul","lastName":"Lewis"},"jobs":[{"companyName":"Gadens","companyUrl":"https://www.linkedin.com/company/20437/","jobTitle":"Partner","dateRange":"May 2018 – Present","location":"Sydney, Australia","description":"Family Lawyer and Mediator (NMAS), Accredited Specialist in Family Law and Dispute\n      \n      Resolution, Collaborative Lawyer"},{"companyName":"Interrelate Limited","companyUrl":"https://www.linkedin.com/company/1376403/","jobTitle":"Board Director","dateRange":"Jan 2007 – May 2018","location":"Sydney, Australia","description":"Interrelate is a community based organisation that provides counselling, mediation, supervised contact and other family support services to children, adults and families across New South Wales.

As a Partner at Gibson & Gibson Lawyers prior to 2013, I acted for some of WA's largest trade unions and their members on Industrial Relations and Employment Law matters. I also appeared as Counsel in Professional Negligence, Personal Injuries, Workers' Compensation, Property Law and Strata Titles matters.\n\nMore recently, between 2013 and 2018 I led Slater & Gordon's General Law Division in Perth, working on Commercial Litigation and Estate Litigation matters.  \n\nThe breadth of my experience has enabled me to guide my clients to resolution of complex and multifaceted matters, drawing on pragmatism, sound logic, creativity and strategic thinking.\n\nI maintain a strong involvement in the community acting on several boards and tribunals of sports clubs. \n\nFor the previous 3 years I fulfilled the role of President of Strata Community WA, the professional body for strata managers, lot owners and strata companies. I continue on SCA Council as immediate past President.","firstName":"Rachel","lastName":"Cosentino"},"jobs":[{"companyName":"Francis Burt Chambers","companyUrl":"https://www.linkedin.com/company/18655271/","jobTitle":"Barrister","dateRange":"Jul 2018 – Present","location":"Perth, Australia","description":null},{"companyName":"Slater & Gordon Lawyers","companyUrl":"https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/index/?keywords=Slater%20%26%20Gordon%20Lawyers","jobTitle":"Practice Group Leader, Business and Specialised Litigation Services","dateRange":"Aug 2013 – Present","location":"Perth Area, Australia","description":null},{"companyName":"Gibson & Gibson Lawyers","companyUrl":"https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/index/?keywords=Gibson%20%26%20Gibson%20Lawyers","jobTitle":"Principal, Litigation","dateRange":"Apr 2005 – Aug 2013","location":"Perth, Australia","description":null}],"schools":[],"details":{"linkedinProfile":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/rachel-cosentino-3a788542","websites":"francisburt.com.au"},"skills":[{"name":"Employment Law","endorsements":"31"},{"name":"Litigation","endorsements":"29"},{"name":"Legal Advice","endorsements":"23"},{"name":"Commercial Litigation","endorsements":"14"},{"name":"Property Law","endorsements":"14"},{"name":"Civil Litigation","endorsements":"7"},{"name":"Medical Malpractice","endorsements":"7"},{"name":"Administrative Law","endorsements":"4"},{"name":"Legal Assistance","endorsements":"4"},{"name":"Consumer Law","endorsements":"4"},{"name":"Dispute Resolution","endorsements":"17"},{"name":"Alternative Dispute Resolution","endorsements":"6"},{"name":"Mediation","endorsements":"5"},{"name":"Industrial Relations","endorsements":"4"},{"name":"Discrimination","endorsements":"6"},{"name":"Professional Negligence","endorsements":"4"},{"name":"Sports Law","endorsements":"2"},{"name":"Employment Contracts","endorsements":"2"},{"name":"Estate Law","endorsements":"2"},{"name":"Strata Management","endorsements":"2"},{"name":"Estate Litigation","endorsements":"0"},{"name":"Strata Titles","endorsements":"2"},{"name":"Equal Opportunity and Human Rights","endorsements":"0"}],"allSkills":"Employment Law, Litigation, Legal Advice, Commercial Litigation, Property Law, Civil Litigation, Medical Malpractice, Administrative Law, Legal Assistance, Consumer Law, Dispute Resolution, Alternative Dispute Resolution, Mediation, Industrial Relations, Discrimination, Professional Negligence, Sports Law, Employment Contracts, Estate Law, Strata Management, Estate Litigation, Strata Titles, Equal Opportunity and Human Rights"},{"general":{"imgUrl":"https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/C5603AQEiHtuz9adSLA/profile-displayphoto-shrink_800_800/0?e=1545264000&v=beta&t=ASpoF6R7tu3-cvTiukysov8VN92pIwFB8fKJpnq_wV4","fullName":"John Poynton","headline":"--","location":"Australia","connections":"500+","description":"","firstName":"John","lastName":"Poynton"},"jobs":[],"schools":[],"details":{"linkedinProfile":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/jhpoynton"},"skills":[],"allSkills":""},{"general":{"fullName":"Joanne M.","headline":"Senior Legal Assistant","school":"Southern Cross University","location":"Sydney, Australia","connections":"207","description":"Exceptionally capable, confident and enthusiastic.

Certificate in Education for Sustainability, to put some of my lessons into practice and 'teach' local children (and adults!) what I have learned.\n\nI lead visitors - including groups of school children, or kindergarten groups, and their teachers / parents / guardians - in learning about the immediate environment of Kumbartcho's 6 hectare grounds (the former 'Bunya Park Zoo'); I participate in subtle but sociable supervision of the small ones in particular, relate stories of the fauna and flora of the area, explain higher-level scientific concepts to older primary school students (for example, leading talks on erosion, water quality, and ecological processes), and act as a 'runner' for other volunteers at times / when necessary (tasks and 'lessons' being tacitly shared amongst those available each day).\n\nI assist, as part of a very small team, in administration at Kumbartcho, and have recently provided some services in relation to the upgrade of the organisation's website (providing editorial assistance, photography, social media marketing, etcetera; I am also an Administrator of Kumbartcho's Facebook page, posting scheduled updates and generating 'traffic' to the site).\n\nI have my own Unique Student Identifier number, a valid 'Blue Card' for Working with Children, and upgraded First Aid/CPR skills from this wonderful organisation!\n\nIn fulfilling these roles, I have assisted many people from the surrounding communities with environmental and educational enquiries (feedback received being very positive so far, particularly relating to my friendliness
