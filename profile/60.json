Although my career is still in its early stages, I have already worn many hats. I have a strong ability to utilise all of the skills I have learnt to date in my everyday work, and I am always looking for a new challenge.\n\nI am curious by nature and love to read, learn, travel and take advantage of new experiences. Following this passion, I have volunteered overseas, worked in different public sector agencies and actively participate on committees and working groups to both advance and create new opportunities for myself and my peers.\n\nI have a great eye for detail which allows me to pick up on the smaller things that are often missed. I am ambitious, enjoy a fast paced working environment and try to learn one new thing each day.\n\nI welcome new professional acquaintances. \n\nTo connect with me, please contact me at Janice.Lamb@dpc.vic.gov.au.",

I experienced and participated in a range of work including conducting legal research, drafting employment contracts and working with other team members to establish precedents and internal research databases. \n\nI also completed an 8 week rotation in Jackson McDonald's Legal Technology Support team that assists other teams in the firm in document management, particularly in large scale litigation discovery. My time spent in this team was invaluable, as I was exposed to a wide range of technologies and databases and I was encouraged to develop my project management skills. I also learnt the importance of delivering good instructions to others when delegating work. \n\nAdmitted on 16 December 2016, I am now a Solicitor in Jackson McDonald's Dispute Resolution and Litigation team. \n\nSince arriving in the team in January 2017, I have worked on 3 large commercial litigation matters relating to contract disputes, intellectual property and construction. I also enjoy assisting in pro bono litigation matters and assist in Legal Aid's community legal education program 'R U Legal?'. In 2016, I also undertook a secondment at the Street Law Centre in East Perth. \n\nI am a keen member of Jackson McDonald's Branching Out Committee which assists junior professionals to develop their business development and networking skills and provides them with opportunities to put those skills into practice."
