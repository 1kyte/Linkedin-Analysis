From general business advice, to documents and representation across a variety of areas (think property, buy and sell, restraint of trade, liquor licensing and franchising to name a few). \n\nCollaboration is key to our approach - we collaborate across each of our internal specialist teams, and externally with consultants and other legal advisors, to give you the best expertise to assist whatever issues you or your business are facing. Personally, I help individuals, SMEs and national businesses in  resolving commercial disputes. I have a particular interest in property, construction and franchising disputes.\n\nMy main focus, and that of all of our lawyers, is understanding that the best 'legal' answer is not necessarily the best way forward. In most cases practicality, ongoing business considerations and general common sense are equally important. The ability to collaborate with other expert professionals assists to produce a more successful and lasting outcome.  The ability to write in clear and simple language is also a major focus for all of us at Cullen Macleod. \n\nMy experience before Cullen Macleod included working in mining camps, at the Law Reform Commission of WA, teaching at Murdoch University Law School and working for the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court Western Australia.  I am currently a  member of various Boards and Committees including the Austral Asia Centre for Legal Innovation, Piddington Society,  Western Suburbs Business Association, Business Advisory Council Autism Association of WA, Subiaco Community Legal Centre.\n\nI have a particular interest in how the legal services industry is changing, and how technology and new ways of working can bring greater efficiency and better outcomes to clients, and more interesting and satisfying work to those within the legal  industry.","firstName":"Catriona","lastName":"Macleod"},"jobs":[{"companyName":"Cullen

on growing impact investment in conversation with impact businesses, government, CSR and private wealth, and demonstrating why the ‘business for good’ model works in bridging investment and philanthropy. \n\nImpact investment has the capacity to create solutions to society’s biggest problems through the power of the markets, and the Social Businesses we set out to nurture are investable enterprises, with a clear social impact mission front and centre.  \n\nWe’re passionate about social innovation, creating sustainable social impact and creating a working space for Social Businesses to be identified, supported and to thrive.  We want to build the pool of investment, and the number of investments in Social Businesses that can provide market-rate return to investors and social impact at once.\n\n60% of HNWI’s see driving social impact with their investments as ‘extremely or very important’ and an overwhelming majority of under 40’s are conscious consumers.  In this environment, it simply makes sense for Social Businesses to enjoy market share uplift, improved defensibility and investor returns. \n\n“When they discover that they have a conscious competitor, traditional companies are likely to find that their ability to attract customers, employees, investors and suppliers will diminish greatly.” (Ernst & Young – Conscious Capitalism)"},{"companyName":"Pharmacy 777","companyUrl":"https://www.linkedin.com/company/250546/","jobTitle":"Pharmacy Assistant","dateRange":"Jul 2008 – Feb

create strong relationships which are based on trust.\n\nMany sophisticated tools and technologies, as well as proven methodologies and techniques can help you build and manage your relationships with clients. The relationships you and your organisation maintain with your clients and contacts form the foundation for success.\n\nThe one thing that the most advanced systems or processes cannot do for you is to understand the ‘human’ aspect of these client relationships. Every client is unique; the organisation’s objectives and strategies, the market in which it operates and, last but not least, the people who sit across the table from you. My focus is to observe clients’ movements, market developments and trends to help identify opportunities and develop strategies to achieve commercial outcomes for the firm. The experience I have gained working with a variety of clients and contacts in both Switzerland and Australia has helped me to understand how these interactions can create opportunities for growth.\n\nPetit nunu – if you never try, you will never know...\n\nDuring my career break in 2014, I had the pleasure of being a full-time father to my baby daughter. The benefit of being surrounded by babies and toddlers every day was that I found a market niche I decided to explore further.
