I focus on complex and large scale property investments and divestments, including substantial real estate and hotel development and refurbishment projects and multi-jurisdictional projects for major on-shore and off-shore sales and acquisitions. \n\nMy clients include family office, private, government and quasi-government organisations, large institutional and corporate investors, hotel management companies, listed and unlisted REITs, pension and insurance funds and fund managers.  Recent projects include acting for Home Investment Consortium in its acquisition and Australia-wide redevelopment of the former Masters property portfolio, and GAW Capital in its acquisition of the Bell City complex.\n\nI have experience across the full range of general commercial property matters including real estate aspects of large M&A transactions, lease and property portfolio management, privatisation of public infrastructure facilities, and large scale residential, commercial and hotel development projects.\n\nI am passionate about community service and pro bono and feel that it is part of the legal profession's responsibility to support these areas, taking a leading role in a variety of Baker McKenzie's pro bono programs.  As an endurance athlete, I also use personal challenges to raise funds for charity and am particularly focused on those that empower children, including the Steve Waugh Foundation (as a 4-time participant of its 800km+ Captain's Ride cycling event) which raises funds for children and young adults with rare diseases, and the Classroom of Hope and Bali Children's Foundation (which fund entire generations of children through the primary school years in rural areas of Bali) through participation in the Bali Hope Ultra Marathon.",

In the first 6 months, he reviewed numerous properties, applying rigorous feasibility analyses and generating substantial financial performance, thus laying the groundwork for negotiations and planning to funnel these projects into DEV Venture’s pipeline for further consideration. During his time at DEV, Shawn helped secure and lead multiple key development projects including establishing a residential building arm as part of the organization’s strong hold in the marketplace. He frequently draws from his base understanding of residential construction and land development, gained from his 20 plus years experience in the industry along with his completion of a Master of Business Management in 2006.\n\nSeizing an opportunity to hone his multi-faceted operational skills and fulfill his entrepreneurial passion, Shawn launched Rushbrook Homes & Communities to build on current and future developments that suit the organization’s criteria. His background as a licensed Mortgage Broker enabled him to acquire and manage Institutional and corporate divestitures, turnarounds, and private syndications, including immigrant investment programs to fund resort developments and land acquisitions.\nWith more than 20 years’ broad-based general management experience, he understands how each part of an operation functions on a very deep level. He also knows that it is imperative for companies to continuously review competition outside their normal, established competitors, as technology, business dynamics and globalization can create entirely new sources of competition."

Since then she has been studying the therapeutic properties of cannabis, how it works in the human body and the potential applications in General Practice, especially in the management of chronic debilitating pain.\n\nIn 2016, Dr Towpik founded MediHuanna, an organisation that provides science-based medicinal cannabis education for Health Professionals. Dr Towpik sees cannabis as a therapeutic agent that has huge potential in General Practice. Her goal is to change the stigma of cannabis through education, enabling it to be seen as an important medicine that should be integrated into modern medicine.",

Conveniently, this means that my diverse experiences have given me a unique insight into how different levels of commerce operate both domestically and internationally, with a particular focus on Asia. With each pivot, I have been able to narrow my scope and passion for exactly where I wish to focus my career in the future.\n\nMy colleagues know me as an enthusiastic problem-solver who is always eager to look for new ways to solve existing issues. I'm a strong believer in the 'fail fast - fail often' method of problem solving insofar as you never make the same mistake twice. This is a mentality that I bring to work every day.",
