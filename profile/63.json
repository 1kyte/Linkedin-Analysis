I didn't realise it then but my competitive nature and personal drive have been part of the reason for my success as a professional athlete. i love challenges and love meeting new people. I don't take myself to seriously and love to have a laugh. Although i am seen as a bit of a larikan there is a professional side to me that i had to adapt to over the years, as i got more experience at St Kilda football club. I naturally moved into a leadership position that i really enjoyed and with that came great responsibility. over the past 13 years i have matured quickly and have been able to channel my energy into the things i love, family and football. I have taken those two things that are close to my heart as far as i can and now i am ready for the next phase in my life. I like to keep things simple, i have enough experience and personal confidence to take on just about everything. I want to work on something that i am passionate about and whoever i am working with will get the best out of me.",

Further to that, Command 51 does all of the gardening for Hungry Jacks in NSW and on a daily basis clean over 100 sites from Brisbane, Sydney to Melbourne and everywhere in between. The main thing that sets Command 51 apart from most other service providers is the accountability that the team pride themselves on. Every venue that Command 51 services, regardless if it's cleaning, security or grounds has a client service manage allocated to look after that client, and it's that CSM's job to visit the site once a week and be contactable 7 days a week to make sure that the service that the client is paying for is delivered. That's where I slot in.\n\nSo if any of you know anybody  that is sick of not being able to contact their cleaners or gardeners or just want to make sure that they are paying the right price, please let me know and I will gladly give them a buzz to see how I can help them out.\n\nThanks in advance"

I am a very positive person, and surround myself with people with these common goals and attributes. I love to learn. I aim to seek as much knowledge from those around me as I can, soaking up the information like a sponge. I am passionately pursuing my presenting career with several projects currently underway. \n\nI am an international model based in Perth, experienced in glamour and swimwear photographic, catwalk, competitions, parades and promotions. I hold several national titles and appear regularly in publications worldwide. I also work as a stylist for many of Australia's leading photographers. \n\nWith a love of all things fashionable, I have created my very own designer label \"Delysha Daly Collection\". This range features new innovative styles for lingerie and swimwear competition and event wear, coupled with slick dress designs for smart business wear. The label is set to launch at an exclusive VIP function at Gold Bar in Subiaco later November 2012.  \n\nInterior design has always been a hobby for me, renovating our units was an opportunity to put plans into practice. Through this evolved my new business Style My Pad which is an online company that distributes the latest trends in furniture and bedding worldwide. I now oversee the sales team based Perth, Western Australia. \n\nMy amazing husband, Eoin Daly, and I began a real estate portfolio together of which I presently manage also. \n\nThrough effective and efficient management, all three of my businesses run autonomously, creating sufficient passive income to support my next exciting business plan.
