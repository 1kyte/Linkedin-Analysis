She looks beyond the obvious, peeling apart the layers by asking the right questions at the right time. She makes the connections, builds the relationships, digging deeper and aiming higher.  As the founding Director of Who Am I Projects, Lisa successfully combines accreditations, skills and experience with an incredible sense of curiosity, intuition and compassion. She’s also a diehard 80’s fan (don’t judge), although she doesn’t mind the occasional 90’s rock (and, naturally, is totally obsessed with Adele). \nAfter starting her career with a Bachelor of Arts in Management Communication and a Certificate IV in Workplace Assessment & Training, Lisa graduated from the renowned Life Coaching Academy.

She will engage, challenge, inspire, and hold people accountable for going after what they want! People are taken to that higher level of achievement where they will know what they didn’t know before and will start acting on that gap between where they are and where they want to be. They will know more about what success (and happiness) means for them and what they need to do to achieve it.\n\nMany will testify that Lisa’s approach is informal and intuitive.  She works with great passion and warmth, and with a strong commitment to results. Her workshops and 'projects' are relevant, high impact and fun.

We take our food supply for granted simply by just heading in to a supermarket & selecting the things we wish to eat or take our fancy. Take a moment to think about how & what we are actually being delivered & who is controlling our food supplies.\n\nThe selection of Fresh Fruit & Vegetable available in your local supermarket is decided based on financial viability of the company. The selection has to be hardy & durable so it survives transport rather then what actually has the best taste. When picked the Fresh Fruit & Vegetable could be stored in Cold Storage before being transported either Domestically or Internationally for hundreds of kilometers before actually reaching the shelf and your plate. Therefore the Fresh fruit that you are putting in to your body could have been picked months prior to you purchasing it. Now argument is that this has been happening for many years & this is true to some extent.\n\nUpgrades in technology means that they have been able to extend the lifespan of the Fruit & Vegetables using chemicals that are considered harmless for humans to consume however are really still too young to know the full effects that they may have on our heart, soul & minds. Although we are told these are safe chemicals and do not effect the produce in any way we need to take some responsibilities of what we put in to our bodies & make a conscious decision to look after ourselves the best we can.\n\nSprouting Good Rooftop farms are organic & due to our local positions we are able to deliver fresh fruit & vegetables to suppliers with minimal time from Harvest. People question about particles in the air effecting the crops but as the pollution that can effect our produce weighs more then air they are found at ground level not in the air around our farms giving us the opportunity to provide food excellence."},{"companyName":"52 Ways","companyUrl":"https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/index/?keywords=52%20Ways","jobTitle":"Chief Engagement Officer","dateRange":"Jan 2017 – Dec 2017","location":"Australia and New Zealand","description":"Are you a business owner that's...\n\nNot Generating Enough Leads?\nWorking Too Many Hours?\nNot Making Enough Profit?\nOverwhelmed With Technology?\n\nIf you’ve answered YES to any of the issues above, don’t worry, you are not alone.

My first experience with change was on the rollout of digital television in Australia, which was launched in 2001 and I was lucky enough to work on the policy framework, the regulation development and then deliver public relations when Digital TV switched on in 2001.  After this amazing experience, I moved into the law field with an organisation that allowed me to develop my marketing nous over 5 years with pitching to clients and designing public sector engagement events. I helped design and implement a bespoke CRM system before these systems had any traction in the cloud!  \n\nMy next move was into accountancy and law, and I was fortunate enough to work on communications for IT change projects that impacted the Large Business Market.  I implemented the first GovDex workspace at ATO with my Large Business Stakeholders and I was responsible for stakeholder and client engagement with groups such as the Corporate Tax Association.  From there I moved across to the Department of Human Services and took on the role of Editor for News for Seniors - I reengineered the publication, saved the organisation significant money and increased the readability of the 32 page magazine to our 2.2 million pensioners.\n\nI was approached to be the stakeholder engagement strategist to shift 40,000 employees into the SAP environment at DHS before moving onto australia.gov.au where I developed the communication strategy for transitioning 6.2 million customers into online services.  \n\nIn 2013, I left the public service to pursue Redgrass Communications.","firstName":"Sonia","lastName":"Irwin AMAMI CPM"},"jobs":[{"companyName":"Redgrass Communications","companyUrl":"https://www.linkedin.com/company/7586029/","jobTitle":"Founder and Strategist","dateRange":"Feb 2007 – Present","location":"Canberra","description":"Currently designing and transforming a Govt ICT Branch of people 450 into an agile business model, including creation of product suites, client engagement pathways and redesigning core business capability.\n\n*Organisational Change Manager at Department of Health for NDSS\n*Organisational Change Manager and Change Communicator for Community Grants Hub with Department of Social Services.\n*Researched and undertook stakeholder engagement  and report as part of an advising service to WDScott for National Diabetes Australia.\n* Created, funded and delivered Convergence Australia - Optimising your organisational change three years in a row - a social enterprise dedicated to raising the capability of organisations to adapt and thrive in a disrupted world while keeping people on the journey.

設備及裝置——例如焗爐、洗衣機、地毯、窗簾等\n2. 樓宇結構及相關工程——例如混凝土、磚牆等\n\n「物業折舊報告」怎樣可以幫到您？\n很簡單，折舊報告可以幫您減低應繳的稅款，我們可讓您知道物業折舊的價值，以用作抵消您的稅務支出。物業折舊又稱非現金可減少的稅款，它是唯一的折舊不用額外付錢。因為物業折舊沒有真正的現金交易，所以可減少的稅款已包含在賣買樓宇的價格內。\n\n物業折舊報告不是會計師做的嗎？\n當然不是，會計師只可以幫助你處理一般稅務，但專業的物業折舊報告一定要由「澳洲稅務從業委員會註冊的代理及建築物料測量師」準備的才合符稅務局的認同。\n\n準備一份折舊報告收費昂貴嗎？\n折舊報告的收費視乎物業的位置、大小和其他因素而定，您現在所支付的費用與將來減少的稅款比較，實在是物超所值，明智選擇，而且收據可作為扣稅之用。\n\n爲何選擇大生折舊？\n•收據可作爲100％扣稅之用\n•報吿合符澳洲稅務局規格要求\n•大生折舊是合規格的物料測量師公司及稅務從業委員會註冊的代理\n\nwww.titustax.com.au

We offer a \"one-stop\" shop for applicants by working with immigration specialists, as well as the providers of various complying funds & concierge services. Thus, we provide high level 'connectivity' between wealthy clients & the Australian Investor Visa industry.\n\nIn particular, the Business Innovation & Investment (Provisional) visa (subclass 188C), launched in Nov 2012, allows wealthy migrants to fast-track residency in exchange for investing A$5m in complying investments for a four-year period. Applicants looking to reside in Australia no longer need to satisfy the innovation points test or upper age limits. This visa features a residence requirement of only 160 days spent in Australia over four years with no restrictions on work, travel or study for the investor and their family, thereby offering an attractive pathway to Australia.\n\nThere are two key people in your application process you need to be comfortable with – the person handling your investment & the person handling your visa application. For an application to be successful, it is important to have a registered migration agent, good communication lines with the Government, a concrete plan for identifying the source of & transfer of funds; as well as understanding the limited time allowed for funds transfer.\n\nUnder new SIV investment rules, from Jul 2015, 40% of the $5m must be invested in areas that support innovation through early stage venture capital ($0.5m) & small companies ($1.5m). The balance ($3m) can continue to be invested in Australian managed funds.\n\nWe are able to structure investor-specific & tailored solutions. Investors seeking a commercial or compliant investment can choose from a range of businesses or a suite of SIV Funds that meet their risk profile & investment objectives."},{"companyName":"Financial Centres Australia Pty Ltd","companyUrl":"https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/index/?keywords=Financial%20Centres%20Australia%20Pty%20Ltd","jobTitle":"Managing Director","dateRange":"Jun 1990 – Present","location":"Sydney, Australia","description":"We provide advice to wholesale clients, particularly those who may be interested in Australian residency under the 188 Significant Investor Visa 重大投资者签证 (SIV).
